If any check or other instrument received by Lender as payment under the Note or this Security Instrument is returned to Lender unpaid, Lender may require that any or all subsequent payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument be made in one or more of the following forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank check, treasurer's check, or cashier's check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a U.S. federal agency, instrumentality, or entity; or (d) Electronic Fund Transfer.\nPayments are deemed received by Lender when received at the location designated in the Note or at such other location as may be designated by Lender in accordance with the notice provisions in Section 16. Lender may accept or return any Partial Payments in its sole discretion pursuant to Section 2.\nAny offset or claim that Borrower may have now or in the future against Lender will not relieve Borrower from making the full amount of all payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument or performing the covenants and agreements secured by this Security Instrument.\n2. Acceptance and Application of Payments or Proceeds.\n(a) Acceptance and Application of Partial Payments. Lender may accept and either apply or hold in suspense Partial Payments in its sole discretion in accordance with this Section 2. Lender is not obligated\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 4 of 18\n8000327681\nto accept any Partial Payments or to apply any Partial Payments at the time such payments are accepted, and also is not obligated to pay interest on such unapplied funds. Lender may hold such unapplied funds until Borrower makes payment sufficient to cover a full Periodic Payment, at which time the amount of the full Periodic Payment will be applied to the Loan. If Borrower does not make such a payment within a reasonable period of time, Lender will either apply such funds in accordance with this Section 2 or return them to Borrower. If not applied earlier, Partial Payments will be credited against the total amount due under the Loan in calculating the amount due in connection with any foreclosure proceeding, payoff request, loan modification, or reinstatement. Lender may accept any payment insufficient to bring the Loan current without waiver of any rights under this Security Instrument or prejudice to its rights to refuse such payments in the future.\n(b) Order of Application of Partial Payments and Periodic Payments. Except as otherwise described in this Section 2, if Lender applies a payment, such payment will be applied to each Periodic Payment in the order in which it became due, beginning with the oldest outstanding Periodic Payment, as follows: first to interest and then to principal due under the Note, and finally to Escrow Items. If all outstanding Periodic Payments then due are paid in full, any payment amounts remaining may be applied to late charges and to any amounts then due under this Security Instrument. If all sums then due under the Note and this Security Instrument are paid in full, any remaining payment amount may be applied, in Lender's sole discretion, to a future Periodic Payment or to reduce the principal balance of the Note.\nIf Lender receives a payment from Borrower in the amount of one or more Periodic Payments and the amount of any late charge due for a delinquent Periodic Payment, the payment may be applied to the delinquent payment and the late charge.\nWhen applying payments, Lender will apply such payments in accordance with Applicable Law.\n(c) Voluntary Prepayments. Voluntary prepayments will be applied as described in the Note.\n(d) No Change to Payment Schedule. Any application of payments, insurance proceeds, or Miscellaneous Proceeds to principal due under the Note will not extend or postpone the due date, or change the amount, of the Periodic Payments.\n3. Funds for Escrow Items.\n(a) Escrow Requirement; Escrow Items. Borrower must pay to Lender on the day Periodic Payments are due under the Note, until the Note is paid in full, a sum of money to provide for payment of amounts due for all Escrow Items (the \"Funds\"). The amount of the Funds required to be paid each month may change during the term of the Loan. Borrower must promptly furnish to Lender all notices or invoices of amounts to be paid under this Section 3.\n(b) Payment of Funds; Waiver. Borrower must pay Lender the Funds for Escrow Items unless Lender waives this obligation in writing. Lender may waive this obligation for any Escrow Item at any time. In the event of such waiver, Borrower must pay directly, when and where payable, the amounts due for any Escrow Items subject to the waiver. If Lender has waived the requirement to pay Lender the Funds for any or all Escrow Items, Lender may require Borrower to provide proof of direct payment of those items within such time period as Lender may require. Borrower's obligation to make such timely payments and to provide proof of payment is deemed to be a covenant and agreement of Borrower under this Security Instrument. If Borrower is obligated to pay Escrow Items directly pursuant to a waiver, and Borrower fails to pay timely the amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender may exercise its rights under Section 9 to pay such amount and Borrower will be obligated to repay to Lender any such amount in accordance with Section 9.\nLender may withdraw the waiver as to any or all Escrow Items at any time by giving a notice in accordance with Section 16; upon such withdrawal, Borrower must pay to Lender all Funds for such Escrow Items, and in such amounts, that are then required under this Section 3.\n(c) Amount of Funds; Application of Funds. Lender may, at any time, collect and hold Funds in an amount up to, but not in excess of, the maximum amount a lender can require under RESPA. Lender will estimate the amount of Funds due in accordance with Applicable Law.\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT CX 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 5 of 18\n8000327681\nThe Funds will be held in an institution whose deposits are insured by a U.S. federal agency, instrumentality, or entity (including Lender, if Lender is an institution whose deposits are so insured) or in any Federal Home Loan Bank. Lender will apply the Funds to pay the Escrow Items no later than the time specified under RESPA. Lender may not charge Borrower for: (i) holding and applying the Funds; (ii) annually analyzing the escrow account; or (iii) verifying the Escrow Items, unless Lender pays Borrower interest on the Funds and Applicable Law permits Lender to make such a charge. Unless Lender and Borrower agree in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on the Funds, Lender will not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on the Funds. Lender will give to Borrower, without charge, an annual accounting of the Funds as required by RESPA.\n(d) Surplus; Shortage and Deficiency of Funds. In accordance with RESPA, if there is a surplus of Funds held in escrow, Lender will account to Borrower for such surplus. If Borrower's Periodic Payment is delinquent by more than 30 days, Lender may retain the surplus in the escrow account for the payment of the Escrow Items unless prohibited by Applicable Law. If there is a shortage or deficiency of Funds held in escrow, Lender will notify Borrower and Borrower will pay to Lender the amount necessary to make up the shortage or deficiency in accordance with RESPA.\nUpon payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender will promptly refund to Borrower any Funds held by Lender.\n4. Charges; Liens. Borrower must pay (a) all taxes, assessments, charges, fines, and impositions attributable to the Property which have priority or may attain priority over this Security Instrument, (b) leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if any, and (c) Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any. If any of these items are Escrow Items, Borrower will pay them in the manner provided in Section 3.\nBorrower must promptly discharge any lien that has priority or may attain priority over this Security Instrument unless Borrower: (aa) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a manner acceptable to Lender, but only so long as Borrower is performing under such agreement; (bb) contests the lien in good faith by, or defends against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings which Lender determines, in its sole discretion, operate to prevent the enforcement of the lien while those proceedings are pending, but only until such proceedings are concluded; or (cc) secures from the holder of the lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender that subordinates the lien to this Security Instrument (collectively, the \"Required Actions\"). If Lender determines that any part of the Property is subject to a lien that has priority or may attain priority over this Security Instrument and Borrower has not taken any of the Required Actions in regard to such lien, Lender may give Borrower a notice identifying the lien. Within 10 days after the date on which that notice is given, Borrower must satisfy the lien or take one or more of the Required Actions.\n5. Property Insurance.\n(a) Insurance Requirement; Coverages. Borrower must keep the improvements now existing or subsequently erected on the Property insured against loss by fire, hazards included within the term \"extended coverage,\" and any other hazards including, but not limited to, earthquakes, winds, and floods, for which Lender requires insurance. Borrower must maintain the types of insurance Lender requires in the amounts (including deductible levels) and for the periods that Lender requires. What Lender requires pursuant to the preceding sentences can change during the term of the Loan, and may exceed any minimum coverage required by Applicable Law. Borrower may choose the insurance carrier providing the insurance, subject to Lender's right to disapprove Borrower's choice, which right will not be exercised unreasonably.\n(b) Failure to Maintain Insurance. If Lender has a reasonable basis to believe that Borrower has failed to maintain any of the required insurance coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance coverage, at Lender's option and at Borrower's expense. Unless required by Applicable Law, Lender is under no obligation to advance premiums for, or to seek to reinstate, any prior lapsed coverage obtained by Borrower. Lender is under no obligation to purchase any particular type or amount of coverage and may\nWASHINGTON-Single Family-Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 6 of 18\n8000327681\nselect the provider of such insurance in its sole discretion. Before purchasing such coverage, Lender will notify Borrower if required to do so under Applicable Law. Any such coverage will insure Lender, but might not protect Borrower, Borrower's equity in the Property, or the contents of the Property, against any risk, hazard, or liability and might provide greater or lesser coverage than was previously in effect, but not exceeding the coverage required under Section 5(a). Borrower acknowledges that the cost of the insurance coverage so obtained may significantly exceed the cost of insurance that Borrower could have obtained. Any amounts disbursed by Lender for costs associated with reinstating Borrower's insurance policy or with placing new insurance under this Section 5 will become additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts will bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and will be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.\n(c) Insurance Policies. All insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies: (i) will be subject to Lender's right to disapprove such policies; (ii) must include a standard mortgage clause; and (iii) must name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee. Lender will have the right to hold the policies and renewal certificates. If Lender requires, Borrower will promptly give to Lender proof of paid premiums and renewal notices. If Borrower obtains any form of insurance coverage, not otherwise required by Lender, for damage to, or destruction of, the Property, such policy must include a standard mortgage clause and must name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee.\n(d) Proof of Loss; Application of Proceeds. In the event of loss, Borrower must give prompt notice to the insurance carrier and Lender. Lender may make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Any insurance proceeds, whether or not the underlying insurance was required by Lender, will be applied to restoration or repair of the Property, if Lender deems the restoration or repair to be economically feasible and determines that Lender's security will not be lessened by such restoration or repair.\nIf the Property is to be repaired or restored, Lender will disburse from the insurance proceeds any initial amounts that are necessary to begin the repair or restoration, subject to any restrictions applicable to Lender. During the subsequent repair and restoration period, Lender will have the right to hold such insurance proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender's satisfaction (which may include satisfying Lender's minimum eligibility requirements for persons repairing the Property, including, but not limited to, licensing, bond, and insurance requirements) provided that such inspection must be undertaken promptly. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed, depending on the size of the repair or restoration, the terms of the repair agreement, and whether Borrower is in Default on the Loan. Lender may make such disbursements directly to Borrower, to the person repairing or restoring the Property, or payable jointly to both. Lender will not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such insurance proceeds unless Lender and Borrower agree in writing or Applicable Law requires otherwise. Fees for public adjusters, or other third parties, retained by Borrower will not be paid out of the insurance proceeds and will be the sole obligation of Borrower.\nIf Lender deems the restoration or repair not to be economically feasible or Lender's security would be lessened by such restoration or repair, the insurance proceeds will be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such insurance proceeds will be applied in the order that Partial Payments are applied in Section 2(b).\n(e) Insurance Settlements; Assignment of Proceeds. If Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate, and settle any available insurance claim and related matters. If Borrower does not respond within 30 days to a notice from Lender that the insurance carrier has offered to settle a claim, then Lender may negotiate and settle the claim. The 30-day period will begin when the notice is given. In either event, or if Lender acquires the Property under Section 26 or otherwise, Borrower is unconditionally assigning to Lender (i) Borrower's rights to any insurance proceeds in an amount not to exceed the amounts unpaid under the Note and this Security Instrument, and (ii) any other of Borrower's rights (other than the right to any refund of unearned premiums paid by Borrower) under all insurance policies covering the Property, to the extent that such rights are applicable to the coverage of the Property. If Lender files,\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 7 of 18\n8000327681\nnegotiates, or settles a claim, Borrower agrees that any insurance proceeds may be made payable directly to Lender without the need to include Borrower as an additional loss payee. Lender may use the insurance proceeds either to repair or restore the Property (as provided in Section 5(d)) or to pay amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, whether or not then due.\n6. Occupancy. Borrower must occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower's principal residence within 60 days after the execution of this Security Instrument and must continue to occupy the Property as Borrower's principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender otherwise agrees in writing, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, or unless extenuating circumstances exist that are beyond Borrower's control.\n7. Preservation, Maintenance, and Protection of the Property; Inspections. Borrower will not destroy, damage, or impair the Property, allow the Property to deteriorate, or commit waste on the Property. Whether or not Borrower is residing in the Property, Borrower must maintain the Property in order to prevent the Property from deteriorating or decreasing in value due to its condition. Unless Lender determines pursuant to Section 5 that repair or restoration is not economically feasible, Borrower will promptly repair the Property if damaged to avoid further deterioration or damage.\nIf insurance or condemnation proceeds are paid to Lender in connection with damage to, or the taking of, the Property, Borrower will be responsible for repairing or restoring the Property only if Lender has released proceeds for such purposes. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed, depending on the size of the repair or restoration, the terms of the repair agreement, and whether Borrower is in Default on the Loan. Lender may make such disbursements directly to Borrower, to the person repairing or restoring the Property, or payable jointly to both. If the insurance or condemnation proceeds are not sufficient to repair or restore the Property, Borrower remains obligated to complete such repair or restoration.\nSubject to Applicable Law, Lender may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of the Property and/or may inspect the interior of the improvements on the Property.\n8. Borrower's Loan Application. Borrower will be in Default if, during the Loan application process, Borrower or any persons or entities acting at Borrower's direction or with Borrower's knowledge or consent gave materially false, misleading, or inaccurate information or statements to Lender (or failed to provide Lender with material information) in connection with the Loan, including, but not limited to, overstating Borrower's income or assets, understating or failing to provide documentation of Borrower's debt obligations and liabilities, and misrepresenting Borrower's occupancy or intended occupancy of the Property as Borrower's principal residence.\n9. Protection of Lender's Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security Instrument.\n(a) Protection of Lender's Interest. If: (i) Borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument; (ii) there is a legal proceeding or government order that might significantly affect Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, probate, for condemnation or forfeiture, for enforcement of a lien that has priority or may attain priority over this Security Instrument, or to enforce laws or regulations); or (iii) Lender reasonably believes that Borrower has abandoned the Property, then Lender may do and pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument, including protecting and/or assessing the value of the Property, and securing and/or repairing the Property. Lender's actions may include, but are not limited to: (I) paying any sums secured by a lien that has priority or may attain priority over this Security Instrument; (II) appearing in court; and (III) paying: (A) reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, and other fees and costs associated with the enforcement of this Security Instrument, including but not limited to foreclosure trustee and sheriff's fees and costs; (B) property inspection and valuation fees, unless prohibited by Applicable Law; and (C) other fees incurred for the purpose of protecting Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument, including its secured position in a bankruptcy proceeding. Securing the Property includes, but is not limited to, exterior and interior inspections of the Property, entering the Property to make repairs, changing locks, replacing or\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family-Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT EX 25327.11 :selected:\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 8 of 18\n8000327681\nboarding up doors and windows, draining water from pipes, eliminating building or other code violations or dangerous conditions, and having utilities turned on or off. Although Lender may take action under this Section 9, Lender is not required to do so and is not under any duty or obligation to do so. Lender will not be liable for not taking any or all actions authorized under this Section 9.\n(b) Avoiding Foreclosure; Mitigating Losses. If Borrower is in Default, Lender may work with Borrower to avoid foreclosure and/or mitigate Lender's potential losses, but is not obligated to do so unless required by Applicable Law. Lender may take reasonable actions to evaluate Borrower for available alternatives to foreclosure, including, but not limited to, obtaining credit reports, title reports, title insurance, property valuations, subordination agreements, and third-party approvals. Borrower authorizes and consents to these actions. Any costs associated with such loss mitigation activities may be paid by Lender and recovered from Borrower as described below in Section 9(c), unless prohibited by Applicable Law.\n(c) Additional Amounts Secured. Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 9 will become additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts may bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and will be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.\n(d) Leasehold Terms. If this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower will comply with all the provisions of the lease. Borrower will not surrender the leasehold estate and interests conveyed or terminate or cancel the ground lease. Borrower will not, without the express written consent of Lender, alter or amend the ground lease. If Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and the fee title, will not merge unless Lender agrees to the merger in writing.\n10. Assignment of Rents.\n(a) Assignment of Rents. If the Property is leased to, used by, or occupied by a third party (\"Tenant\"), Borrower is unconditionally assigning and transferring to Lender any Rents, regardless of to whom the Rents are payable. Borrower authorizes Lender to collect the Rents, and agrees that each Tenant will pay the Rents to Lender. However, Borrower will receive the Rents until (i) Lender has given Borrower notice of Default pursuant to Section 26, and (ii) Lender has given notice to the Tenant that the Rents are to be paid to Lender. This Section 10 constitutes an absolute assignment and not an assignment for additional security only.\n(b) Notice of Default. If Lender gives notice of Default to Borrower: (i) all Rents received by Borrower must be held by Borrower as trustee for the benefit of Lender only, to be applied to the sums secured by the Security Instrument; (ii) Lender will be entitled to collect and receive all of the Rents; (iii) Borrower agrees to instruct each Tenant that Tenant is to pay all Rents due and unpaid to Lender upon Lender's written demand to the Tenant; (iv) Borrower will ensure that each Tenant pays all Rents due to Lender and will take whatever action is necessary to collect such Rents if not paid to Lender; (v) unless Applicable Law provides otherwise, all Rents collected by Lender will be applied first to the costs of taking control of and managing the Property and collecting the Rents, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, receiver's fees, premiums on receiver's bonds, repair and maintenance costs, insurance premiums, taxes, assessments, and other charges on the Property, and then to any other sums secured by this Security Instrument; (vi) Lender, or any judicially appointed receiver, will be liable to account for only those Rents actually received; and (vii) Lender will be entitled to have a receiver appointed to take possession of and manage the Property and collect the Rents and profits derived from the Property without any showing as to the inadequacy of the Property as security.\n(c) Funds Paid by Lender. If the Rents are not sufficient to cover the costs of taking control of and managing the Property and of collecting the Rents, any funds paid by Lender for such purposes will become indebtedness of Borrower to Lender secured by this Security Instrument pursuant to Section 9.\n(d) Limitation on Collection of Rents. Borrower may not collect any of the Rents more than one month in advance of the time when the Rents become due, except for security or similar deposits.\n(e) No Other Assignment of Rents. Borrower represents, warrants, covenants, and agrees that\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT EX 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 9 of 18\n8000327681\nBorrower has not signed any prior assignment of the Rents, will not make any further assignment of the Rents, and has not performed, and will not perform, any act that could prevent Lender from exercising its rights under this Security Instrument.\n(f) Control and Maintenance of the Property. Unless required by Applicable Law, Lender, or a receiver appointed under Applicable Law, is not obligated to enter upon, take control of, or maintain the Property before or after giving notice of Default to Borrower. However, Lender, or a receiver appointed under Applicable Law, may do so at any time when Borrower is in Default, subject to Applicable Law.\n(g) Additional Provisions. Any application of the Rents will not cure or waive any Default or invalidate any other right or remedy of Lender. This Section 10 does not relieve Borrower of Borrower's obligations under Section 6.\nThis Section 10 will terminate when all the sums secured by this Security Instrument are paid in full.\n11. Mortgage Insurance.\n(a) Payment of Premiums; Substitution of Policy; Loss Reserve; Protection of Lender. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan, Borrower will pay the premiums required to maintain the Mortgage Insurance in effect. If Borrower was required to make separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, and (i) the Mortgage Insurance coverage required by Lender ceases for any reason to be available from the mortgage insurer that previously provided such insurance, or (ii) Lender determines in its sole discretion that such mortgage insurer is no longer eligible to provide the Mortgage Insurance coverage required by Lender, Borrower will pay the premiums required to obtain coverage substantially equivalent to the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, at a cost substantially equivalent to the cost to Borrower of the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, from an alternate mortgage insurer selected by Lender.\nIf substantially equivalent Mortgage Insurance coverage is not available, Borrower will continue to pay to Lender the amount of the separately designated payments that were due when the insurance coverage ceased to be in effect. Lender will accept, use, and retain these payments as a non-refundable loss reserve in lieu of Mortgage Insurance. Such loss reserve will be non-refundable, even when the Loan is paid in full, and Lender will not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such loss reserve.\nLender will no longer require loss reserve payments if Mortgage Insurance coverage (in the amount and for the period that Lender requires) provided by an insurer selected by Lender again becomes available, is obtained, and Lender requires separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance.\nIf Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan and Borrower was required to make separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower will pay the premiums required to maintain Mortgage Insurance in effect, or to provide a non-refundable loss reserve, until Lender's requirement for Mortgage Insurance ends in accordance with any written agreement between Borrower and Lender providing for such termination or until termination is required by Applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 11 affects Borrower's obligation to pay interest at the Note rate.\n(b) Mortgage Insurance Agreements. Mortgage Insurance reimburses Lender for certain losses Lender may incur if Borrower does not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is not a party to the Mortgage Insurance policy or coverage.\nMortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time to time, and may enter into agreements with other parties that share or modify their risk, or reduce losses. These agreements may require the mortgage insurer to make payments using any source of funds that the mortgage insurer may have available (which may include funds obtained from Mortgage Insurance premiums).\nAs a result of these agreements, Lender, another insurer, any reinsurer, any other entity, or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, may receive (directly or indirectly) amounts that derive from (or might be characterized as) a portion of Borrower's payments for Mortgage Insurance, in exchange for sharing or\nWASHINGTON-Single Family-Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nEXI 25327.11\nPage 10 of 18\n8000327681\nmodifying the mortgage insurer's risk, or reducing losses. Any such agreements will not: (i) affect the amounts that Borrower has agreed to pay for Mortgage Insurance, or any other terms of the Loan; (ii) increase the amount Borrower will owe for Mortgage Insurance; (iii) entitle Borrower to any refund; or (iv) affect the rights Borrower has, if any, with respect to the Mortgage Insurance under the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 (12 U.S.C. Â§ 4901 et seq.), as it may be amended from time to time, or any additional or successor federal legislation or regulation that governs the same subject matter (\"HPA\"). These rights under the HPA may include the right to receive certain disclosures, to request and obtain cancellation of the Mortgage Insurance, to have the Mortgage Insurance terminated automatically, and/or to receive a refund of any Mortgage Insurance premiums that were unearned at the time of such cancellation or termination.\n12. Assignment and Application of Miscellaneous Proceeds; Forfeiture.\n(a) Assignment of Miscellaneous Proceeds. Borrower is unconditionally assigning the right to receive all Miscellaneous Proceeds to Lender and agrees that such amounts will be paid to Lender.\n(b) Application of Miscellaneous Proceeds upon Damage to Property. If the Property is damaged, any Miscellaneous Proceeds will be applied to restoration or repair of the Property, if Lender deems the restoration or repair to be economically feasible and Lender's security will not be lessened by such restoration or repair. During such repair and restoration period, Lender will have the right to hold such Miscellaneous Proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect the Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender's satisfaction (which may include satisfying Lender's minimum eligibility requirements for persons repairing the Property, including, but not limited to, licensing, bond, and insurance requirements) provided that such inspection must be undertaken promptly. Lender may pay for the repairs and restoration in a single disbursement or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed, depending on the size of the repair or restoration, the terms of the repair agreement, and whether Borrower is in Default on the Loan. Lender may make such disbursements directly to Borrower, to the person repairing or restoring the Property, or payable jointly to both. Unless Lender and Borrower agree in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on such Miscellaneous Proceeds, Lender will not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such Miscellaneous Proceeds. If Lender deems the restoration or repair not to be economically feasible or Lender's security would be lessened by such restoration or repair, the Miscellaneous Proceeds will be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such Miscellaneous Proceeds will be applied in the order that Partial Payments are applied in Section 2(b).\n(c) Application of Miscellaneous Proceeds upon Condemnation, Destruction, or Loss in Value of the Property. In the event of a total taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property, all of the Miscellaneous Proceeds will be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower.\nIn the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property (each, a \"Partial Devaluation\") where the fair market value of the Property immediately before the Partial Devaluation is equal to or greater than the amount of the sums secured by this Security Instrument immediately before the Partial Devaluation, a percentage of the Miscellaneous Proceeds will be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing. The amount of the Miscellaneous Proceeds that will be so applied is determined by multiplying the total amount of the Miscellaneous Proceeds by a percentage calculated by taking (i) the total amount of the sums secured immediately before the Partial Devaluation, and dividing it by (ii) the fair market value of the Property immediately before the Partial Devaluation. Any balance of the Miscellaneous Proceeds will be paid to Borrower.\nIn the event of a Partial Devaluation where the fair market value of the Property immediately before the Partial Devaluation is less than the amount of the sums secured immediately before the Partial Devaluation, all of the Miscellaneous Proceeds will be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not the sums are then due, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing.\n(d) Settlement of Claims. Lender is authorized to collect and apply the Miscellaneous Proceeds WASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT Form 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22) [X] 25327.11\nPage 11 of 18\n8000327681\neither to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, or to restoration or repair of the Property, if Borrower (i) abandons the Property, or (ii) fails to respond to Lender within 30 days after the date Lender notifies Borrower that the Opposing Party (as defined in the next sentence) offers to settle a claim for damages. \"Opposing Party\" means the third party that owes Borrower the Miscellaneous Proceeds or the party against whom Borrower has a right of action in regard to the Miscellaneous Proceeds.\n(e) Proceeding Affecting Lender's Interest in the Property. Borrower will be in Default if any action or proceeding begins, whether civil or criminal, that, in Lender's judgment, could result in forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender's interest in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. Borrower can cure such a Default and, if acceleration has occurred, reinstate as provided in Section 20, by causing the action or proceeding to be dismissed with a ruling that, in Lender's judgment, precludes forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender's interest in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. Borrower is unconditionally assigning to Lender the proceeds of any award or claim for damages that are attributable to the impairment of Lender's interest in the Property, which proceeds will be paid to Lender. All Miscellaneous Proceeds that are not applied to restoration or repair of the Property will be applied in the order that Partial Payments are applied in Section 2(b).\n13. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance by Lender Not a Waiver. Borrower or any Successor in Interest of Borrower will not be released from liability under this Security Instrument if Lender extends the time for payment or modifies the amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument. Lender will not be required to commence proceedings against any Successor in Interest of Borrower, or to refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument, by reason of any demand made by the original Borrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy including, without limitation, Lender's acceptance of payments from third persons, entities, or Successors in Interest of Borrower or in amounts less than the amount then due, will not be a waiver of, or preclude the exercise of, any right or remedy by Lender.\n14. Joint and Several Liability; Signatories; Successors and Assigns Bound. Borrower's obligations and liability under this Security Instrument will be joint and several. However, any Borrower who signs this Security Instrument but does not sign the Note: (a) signs this Security Instrument to mortgage, grant, and convey such Borrower's interest in the Property under the terms of this Security Instrument; (b) signs this Security Instrument to waive any applicable inchoate rights such as dower and curtesy and any available homestead exemptions; (c) signs this Security Instrument to assign any Miscellaneous Proceeds, Rents, or other earnings from the Property to Lender; (d) is not personally obligated to pay the sums due under the Note or this Security Instrument; and (e) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower can agree to extend, modify, forbear, or make any accommodations with regard to the terms of the Note or this Security Instrument without such Borrower's consent and without affecting such Borrower's obligations under this Security Instrument.\nSubject to the provisions of Section 19, any Successor in Interest of Borrower who assumes Borrower's obligations under this Security Instrument in writing, and is approved by Lender, will obtain all of Borrower's rights, obligations, and benefits under this Security Instrument. Borrower will not be released from Borrower's obligations and liability under this Security Instrument unless Lender agrees to such release in writing.\n15. Loan Charges.\n(a) Tax and Flood Determination Fees. Lender may require Borrower to pay (i) a one-time charge for a real estate tax verification and/or reporting service used by Lender in connection with this Loan, and (ii) either (A) a one-time charge for flood zone determination, certification, and tracking services, or (B) a one- time charge for flood zone determination and certification services and subsequent charges each time remappings or similar changes occur that reasonably might affect such determination or certification. Borrower will also be responsible for the payment of any fees imposed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or any successor agency, at any time during the Loan term, in connection with any flood zone determinations.\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT EX 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 12 of 18\n8000327681\n(b) Default Charges. If permitted under Applicable Law, Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in connection with Borrower's Default to protect Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument, including: (i) reasonable attorneys' fees and costs; (ii) property inspection and valuation fees; and (iii) other related fees.\n(c) Permissibility of Fees. In regard to any other fees, the absence of express authority in this Security Instrument to charge a specific fee to Borrower should not be construed as a prohibition on the charging of such fee. Lender may not charge fees that are expressly prohibited by this Security Instrument or by Applicable Law.\n(d) Savings Clause. If Applicable Law sets maximum loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted so that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the Loan exceed the permitted limits, then (i) any such loan charge will be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit, and (ii) any sums already collected from Borrower which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to Borrower. Lender may make this refund by reducing the principal owed under the Note or by making a direct payment to Borrower. If a refund reduces principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial prepayment without any prepayment charge (whether or not a prepayment charge is provided for under the Note). To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Borrower's acceptance of any such refund made by direct payment to Borrower will constitute a waiver of any right of action Borrower might have arising out of such overcharge.\n16. Notices; Borrower's Physical Address. All notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument must be in writing.\n(a) Notices to Borrower. Unless Applicable Law requires a different method, any written notice'to Borrower in connection with this Security Instrument will be deemed to have been given to Borrower when (i) mailed by first class mail, or (ii) actually delivered to Borrower's Notice Address (as defined in Section 16(c) below) if sent by means other than first class mail or Electronic Communication (as defined in Section 16(b) below). Notice to any one Borrower will constitute notice to all Borrowers unless Applicable Law expressly requires otherwise. If any notice to Borrower required by this Security Instrument is also required under Applicable Law, the Applicable Law requirement will satisfy the corresponding requirement under this Security Instrument.\n(b) Electronic Notice to Borrower. Unless another delivery method is required by Applicable Law, Lender may provide notice to Borrower by e-mail or other electronic communication (\"Electronic Communication\") if: (i) agreed to by Lender and Borrower in writing; (ii) Borrower has provided Lender with Borrower's e-mail or other electronic address (\"Electronic Address\"); (iii) Lender provides Borrower with the option to receive notices by first class mail or by other non-Electronic Communication instead of by Electronic Communication; and (iv) Lender otherwise complies with Applicable Law. Any notice to Borrower sent by Electronic Communication in connection with this Security Instrument will be deemed to have been given to Borrower when sent unless Lender becomes aware that such notice is not delivered. If Lender becomes aware that any notice sent by Electronic Communication is not delivered, Lender will resend such communication to Borrower by first class mail or by other non-Electronic Communication. Borrower may withdraw the agreement to receive Electronic Communications from Lender at any time by providing written notice to Lender of Borrower's withdrawal of such agreement.\n(c) Borrower's Notice Address. The address to which Lender will send Borrower notice (\"Notice Address\") will be the Property Address unless Borrower has designated a different address by written notice to Lender. If Lender and Borrower have agreed that notice may be given by Electronic Communication, then Borrower may designate an Electronic Address as Notice Address. Borrower will promptly notify Lender of Borrower's change of Notice Address, including any changes to Borrower's Electronic Address if designated as Notice Address. If Lender specifies a procedure for reporting Borrower's change of Notice Address, then Borrower will report a change of Notice Address only through that specified procedure.\n(d) Notices to Lender. Any notice to Lender will be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT (EX 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 13 of 18\n8000327681\nclass mail to Lender's address stated in this Security Instrument unless Lender has designated another address (including an Electronic Address) by notice to Borrower. Any notice in connection with this Security Instrument will be deemed to have been given to Lender only when actually received by Lender at Lender's designated address (which may include an Electronic Address). If any notice to Lender required by this Security Instrument is also required under Applicable Law, the Applicable Law requirement will satisfy the corresponding requirement under this Security Instrument.\n(e) Borrower's Physical Address. In addition to the designated Notice Address, Borrower will provide Lender with the address where Borrower physically resides, if different from the Property Address, and notify Lender whenever this address changes.\n17. Governing Law; Severability; Rules of Construction. This Security Instrument is governed by federal law and the law of the State of Washington. All rights and obligations contained in this Security Instrument are subject to any requirements and limitations of Applicable Law. If any provision of this Security Instrument or the Note conflicts with Applicable Law (i) such conflict will not affect other provisions of this Security Instrument or the Note that can be given effect without the conflicting provision, and (ii) such conflicting provision, to the extent possible, will be considered modified to comply with Applicable Law. Applicable Law might explicitly or implicitly allow the parties to agree by contract or it might be silent, but such silence should not be construed as a prohibition against agreement by contract. Any action required under this Security Instrument to be made in accordance with Applicable Law is to be made in accordance with the Applicable Law in effect at the time the action is undertaken.\nAs used in this Security Instrument: (a) words in the singular will mean and include the plural and vice versa; (b) the word \"may\" gives sole discretion without any obligation to take any action; (c) any reference to \"Section\" in this document refers to Sections contained in this Security Instrument unless otherwise noted; and (d) the headings and captions are inserted for convenience of reference and do not define, limit, or describe the scope or intent of this Security Instrument or any particular Section, paragraph, or provision.\n18. Borrower's Copy. One Borrower will be given one copy of the Note and of this Security Instrument.\n19. Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. For purposes of this Section 19 only, \"Interest in the Property\" means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property, including, but not limited to, those beneficial interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, installment sales contract, or escrow agreement, the intent of which is the transfer of title by Borrower to a purchaser at a future date.\nIf all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender's prior written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, Lender will not exercise this option if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.\nIf Lender exercises this option, Lender will give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice will provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 16 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to, or upon, the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower and will be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing such remedies, including, but not limited to: (a) reasonable attorneys' fees and costs; (b) property inspection and valuation fees; and (c) other fees incurred to protect Lender's Interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument.\n20. Borrower's Right to Reinstate the Loan after Acceleration. If Borrower meets certain conditions, Borrower will have the right to reinstate the Loan and have enforcement of this Security Instrument discontinued at any time up to the later of (a) five days before any foreclosure sale of the Property, or (b) such other period as Applicable Law might specify for the termination of Borrower's right to\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT (EX) 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 14 of 18\n8000327681\nreinstate. This right to reinstate will not apply in the case of acceleration under Section 19.\nTo reinstate the Loan, Borrower must satisfy all of the following conditions: (aa) pay Lender all sums that then would be due under this Security Instrument and the Note as if no acceleration had occurred; (bb) cure any Default of any other covenants or agreements under this Security Instrument or the Note; (cc) pay all expenses incurred in enforcing this Security Instrument or the Note, including, but not limited to: (i) reasonable attorneys' fees and costs; (ii) property inspection and valuation fees; and (iii) other fees incurred to protect Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument or the Note; and (dd) take such action as Lender may reasonably require to assure that Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument or the Note, and Borrower's obligation to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument or the Note, will continue unchanged.\nLender may require that Borrower pay such reinstatement sums and expenses in one or more of the following forms, as selected by Lender: (aaa) cash; (bbb) money order; (ccc) certified check, bank check, treasurer's check, or cashier's check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a U.S. federal agency, instrumentality, or entity; or (ddd) Electronic Fund Transfer. Upon Borrower's reinstatement of the Loan, this Security Instrument and obligations secured by this Security Instrument will remain fully effective as if no acceleration had occurred.\n21. Sale of Note. The Note or a partial interest in the Note, together with this Security Instrument, may be sold or otherwise transferred one or more times. Upon such a sale or other transfer, all of Lender's rights and obligations under this Security Instrument will convey to Lender's successors and assigns.\n22. Loan Servicer. Lender may take any action permitted under this Security Instrument through the Loan Servicer or another authorized representative, such as a sub-servicer. Borrower understands that the Loan Servicer or other authorized representative of Lender has the right and authority to take any such action.\nThe Loan Servicer may change one or more times during the term of the Note. The Loan Servicer may or may not be the holder of the Note. The Loan Servicer has the right and authority to: (a) collect Periodic Payments and any other amounts due under the Note and this Security Instrument; (b) perform any other mortgage loan servicing obligations; and (c) exercise any rights under the Note, this Security Instrument, and Applicable Law on behalf of Lender. If there is a change of the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given written notice of the change which will state the name and address of the new Loan Servicer, the address to which payments should be made, and any other information RESPA requires in connection with a notice of transfer of servicing.\n23. Notice of Grievance. Until Borrower or Lender has notified the other party (in accordance with Section 16) of an alleged breach and afforded the other party a reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action, neither Borrower nor Lender may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial action (either as an individual litigant or a member of a class) that (a) arises from the other party's actions pursuant to this Security Instrument or the Note, or (b) alleges that the other party has breached any provision of this Security Instrument or the Note. If Applicable Law provides a time period that must elapse before certain action can be taken, that time period will be deemed to be reasonable for purposes of this Section 23. The notice of Default given to Borrower pursuant to Section 26(a) and the notice of acceleration given to Borrower pursuant to Section 19 will be deemed to satisfy the notice and opportunity to take corrective action provisions of this Section 23.\n24. Hazardous Substances.\n(a) Definitions. As used in this Section 24: (i) \"Environmental Law\" means any Applicable Laws where the Property is located that relate to health, safety, or environmental protection; (ii) \"Hazardous Substances\" include (A) those substances defined as toxic or hazardous substances, pollutants, or wastes by Environmental Law, and (B) the following substances: gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic petroleum products, toxic pesticides and herbicides, volatile solvents, materials containing asbestos or formaldehyde, corrosive materials or agents, and radioactive materials; (iii) \"Environmental Cleanup\"\nWASHINGTON-Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT [X] 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 15 of 18\nL\n8000327681\nincludes any response action, remedial action, or removal action, as defined in Environmental Law; and (iv) an \"Environmental Condition\" means a condition that can cause, contribute to, or otherwise trigger an Environmental Cleanup.\n(b) Restrictions on Use of Hazardous Substances. Borrower will not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or release of any Hazardous Substances, or threaten to release any Hazardous Substances, on or in the Property. Borrower will not do, nor allow anyone else to do, anything affecting the Property that: (i) violates Environmental Law; (ii) creates an Environmental Condition; or (iii) due to the presence, use, or release of a Hazardous Substance, creates a condition that adversely affects or could adversely affect the value of the Property. The preceding two sentences will not apply to the presence, use, or storage on the Property of small quantities of Hazardous Substances that are generally recognized to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to maintenance of the Property (including, but not limited to, hazardous substances in consumer products).\n(c) Notices; Remedial Actions. Borrower will promptly give Lender written notice of: (i) any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit, or other action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any Hazardous Substance or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge; (ii) any Environmental Condition, including but not limited to, any spilling, leaking, discharge, release, or threat of release of any Hazardous Substance; and (iii) any condition caused by the presence, use, or release of a Hazardous Substance that adversely affects the value of the Property. If Borrower learns, or is notified by any governmental or regulatory authority or any private party, that any removal or other remediation of any Hazardous Substance affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower will promptly take all necessary remedial actions in accordance with Environmental Law. Nothing in this Security Instrument will create any obligation on Lender for an Environmental Cleanup.\n25. Electronic Note Signed with Borrower's Electronic Signature. If the Note evidencing the debt for this Loan is electronic, Borrower acknowledges and represents to Lender that Borrower: (a) expressly consented and intended to sign the electronic Note using an Electronic Signature adopted by Borrower (\"Borrower's Electronic Signature\") instead of signing a paper Note with Borrower's written pen and ink signature; (b) did not withdraw Borrower's express consent to sign the electronic Note using Borrower's Electronic Signature; (c) understood that by signing the electronic Note using Borrower's Electronic Signature, Borrower promised to pay the debt evidenced by the electronic Note in accordance with its terms; and (d) signed the electronic Note with Borrower's Electronic Signature with the intent and understanding that by doing so, Borrower promised to pay the debt evidenced by the electronic Note in accordance with its terms.\nNON-UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:\n26. Acceleration; Remedies.\n(a) Notification of Default. Lender will give a notification of Default to Borrower prior to acceleration following Borrower's Default, except that such notification of Default will not be sent when Lender exercises its right under Section 19 unless Applicable Law provides otherwise. The notification will specify, in addition to any other information required by Applicable Law: (i) the Default; (ii) the action required to cure the Default; (iii) a date, not less than 30 days (or as otherwise specified by Applicable Law) from the date the notification is given to Borrower, by which the Default must be cured; (iv) that failure to cure the Default on or before the date specified in the notification may result in acceleration of the sums secured by this Security Instrument and sale of the Property at public auction; (v) Borrower's right to reinstate after acceleration or commencement of the foreclosure in accordance with Applicable law; and (vi) any other matters required to be included in the notification by Applicable Law.\n(b) Acceleration; Power of Sale; Expenses.

Lender will be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this Section 26, including, but not limited to: (i) reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, and other fees and costs associated with the enforcement of this Security Instrument, including but not limited to, foreclosure trustee's and sheriff's fees and costs, and title costs; (ii) property inspection and valuation fees; and (iii) any other fees incurred to protect Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument unless prohibited by Applicable Law.\n(c) Foreclosure Notices; Sale of Property. If Lender invokes the power of sale, Lender will send notice to Trustee of the occurrence of an event of Default and of Lender's election to cause the Property to be sold. Trustee and/or Lender will take such action regarding any required notices and will give such notices to Borrower and to other recipients as Applicable Law may require. At a time permitted, in accordance with Applicable Law, and after publication of the notice of sale, Trustee, without further demand on Borrower, will sell the Property at public auction to the highest bidder at the time and place and under the terms designated in the notice of sale in one or more parcels and in any order Trustee determines. Trustee may postpone sale of the Property for a period or periods permitted by Applicable Law by public announcement at the time and place fixed in the notice of sale. Lender or its designee may purchase the Property at any sale.\n(d) Trustee's Deed; Proceeds of Sale. Trustee will deliver to the purchaser a Trustee's deed conveying the Property without any covenant or warranty, expressed or implied. The recitals in the Trustee's deed will be prima facie evidence of the truth of the statements made in that deed, Trustee will apply the proceeds of the sale in the following order: (i) to all expenses of the sale, including, but not limited to, reasonable Trustee's and attorneys' fees and costs; (ii) to all sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (iii) the surplus, if any, less the clerk's filing fee, shall be deposited, together with all documents required under Applicable Law, with the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the sale took place.\n27. Reconveyance. Upon payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender will request Trustee to reconvey the Property and will surrender this Security Instrument and all Notes evidencing the debt secured by this Security Instrument to Trustee. Upon such request, Trustee will reconvey the Property without warranty to the person or persons legally entitled to it. Such person or persons will pay any recordation costs and the Trustee's fee for preparing the reconveyance.\n28. Substitute Trustee. In accordance with Applicable Law, Lender may, from time to time, by itself or through the Loan Servicer, or any other authorized representative, appoint a successor trustee to any Trustee appointed under this Security Instrument who has ceased to act. Without conveyance of the Property, the successor trustee will succeed to all the rights, title, power, and duties conferred upon Trustee in this Security Instrument and by Applicable Law.\n29. Use of Property. The Property is not used principally for agricultural purposes.\n30. Attorneys' Fees. Lender will be entitled to recover in any action or proceeding to construe or enforce any term of this Security Instrument (a) its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, and (b) any other fees and costs associated with the enforcement of this Security Instrument, including but not limited to, foreclosure trustee and sheriff's fees and costs and title costs. The term \"attorneys' fees,\" whenever used in this Security Instrument, includes without limitation attorneys' fees incurred by Lender in any bankruptcy proceeding or on appeal.\nORAL AGREEMENTS OR ORAL COMMITMENTS TO LOAN MONEY, EXTEND CREDIT, OR TO FORBEAR FROM ENFORCING REPAYMENT OF A DEBT ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER WASHINGTON LAW.\nWASHINGTON-Single Family-Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT CX 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 17 of 18\n8000327681\nBY SIGNING BELOW, Borrower accepts and agrees to the terms and covenants contained in this Security Instrument and in any Rider signed by Borrower and recorded with it.\nSzalon #\n- BORROWER - CORNELIU MICHAELS Shichants\nSIMONA MICHAELS\n[Space Below This Line for Acknowledgment]\nState of WASHINGTON County of SNOHOMISH\nThis record was acknowledged before me on October 08.2024 by CORNELIU MICHAELS AND SIMONA MICHAELS.\nJana K Quinn MY COMM.

YOUR FUNDS MAY BE AT RISK\nThis Notice is not intended to provide legal or professional advice. If you have any questions, please consult with a lawyer. RealtorsÂ®, Real Estate Brokers, Closing Attorneys, Buyers and Sellers are targets for wire fraud and many have lost hundreds of thousands of dollars because they simply relied on the wire instructions received via email, without further verification.\nA fraudster will hack into a participant's email account to obtain information about upcoming real estate transactions. After monitoring the account to determine the likely timing of a closing, the fraudster will send an email to the Buyer purporting to be the escrow agent or another party to the transaction. The fraudulent email will contain new wiring instructions or routing information, and will request that the Buyer send funds to a fraudulent account.\nPlease be advised that the wire instructions listed below are the only wire instructions we will send you. This is the only form that should be used to wire funds to us in this transaction. If you receive another email or unsolicited call purporting to alter these instructions, please immediately call us at: (425)258-3683.\nWIRE INSTRUCTIONS\n*** ACH ELECTRONIC TRANSFERS WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED AND ARE AUTOMATICALLY REJECTED ***\nBANK NAME:\nUS Bank\nADDRESS:\n535 Westminster Mall, Westminster, CA 92683\nABA NO .:\n122235821\nACCOUNT NO .: 153595257210\nACCOUNT HOLDER: Chicago Title Company of Washington\nREFERENCE: 500149559 / 19806 78th Avenue SE, Snohomish\nIn addition, the following non-exclusive self-protection strategies are recommended to minimize exposure to possible wire fraud.\nNEVER RELY on emails or other communications purporting to change wire instructions.

This account shall be evaluated each year to determine if sufficient funds are available for the payment of bills.\nThe property taxes/assessments in your escrow account established at closing have been assessed based on the current lower (ii) unimproved property, (ii) partially improved property or (iii) reduced tax exemption status.\nThe bills paid out of your escrow account are expected to increase substantially after the first year because taxes are currently based on the lower tax rate, which will result in a re-evaluation. Under normal escrow practices, your monthly escrow payment in the second year could be much higher than in the first. Consequently, you will have a large increase to your total mortgage payment.\nBecause your taxes have not been fully assessed, it is also possible for you to experience a shortage/deficiency in your escrow account. In addition to an increase in your monthly escrow payment that will result from the new fully assessed tax rate, you may also be required to make additional deposits into your escrow account to compensate for any shortage/deficiency.\nThe payment letter enclosed in your loan closing papers is based on the lower tax rate. To avoid a substantial increase, or minimize the amount of any increase to your payment, you may voluntarily choose to make higher escrow payments during the first year.\nThe undersigned acknowledge that I/we have read and understand this notice.\nLola # 10-08-2024\n- BORROWER - CORNELIU MICHAELS - DATE -\nEX Â· 22667.2\nPage 1 of 1\nAppraisal Receipt Form\nMICHAELS Loan #: 8000327681 MIN: 100053680003276816\nDate: OCTOBER 8, 2024 Lender: PRIMELENDING, A PLAINSCAPITAL COMPANY Borrower(s): CORNELIU MICHAELS Property Address: 19806 78TH AVE SE, SNOHOMISH, WA 98296-7929\nYou, the Borrower(s), are entitled to a copy of any and all appraisal report(s) conducted on the property referenced above, no later than three business days prior to the closing of your loan.\nBy signing below, you acknowledge receipt of all copies of your appraisals and/or valuations.\nAdditionally, if an appraisal was not required or ordered on my loan, I acknowledge that I did not receive an appraisal.\nAslan # 10-08-2024\n- BORROWER - CORNELIU MICHAELS - DATE -\n18381.2\nPage 1 of 1\nDate: OCTOBER 8, 2024\nUSA Patriot Act Disclosure Borrower Identification\nMICHAELS Loan #: 8000327681 MIN: 100053680003276816\nIMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT\nTo help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account.\nWhat this means for you: When you open an account, we will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow us to identify you.

For the latest information about developments related to Form W-9 and its instructions, such as legislation enacted after they were published, go to www.irs.gov/FormW9.\nWhat's New\nLine 3a has been modified to clarify how a disregarded entity completes this line. An LLC that is a disregarded entity should check the appropriate box for the tax classification of its owner. Otherwise, it should check the \"LLC\" box and enter its appropriate tax classification.\nNew line 3b has been added to this form. A flow-through entity is required to complete this line to indicate that it has direct or indirect foreign partners, owners, or beneficiaries when it provides the Form W-9 to another flow- through entity in which it has an ownership interest. This change is intended to provide a flow-through entity with information regarding the status of its indirect foreign partners, owners, or beneficiaries, so that it can satisfy any applicable reporting requirements. For example, a partnership that has any indirect foreign partners may be required to complete Schedules K-2 and K- 3. See the Partnership Instructions for Schedules K-2 and K-3 (Form 1065).\nPurpose of Form\nAn individual or entity (Form W-9 requester) who is required to file an information return with the IRS is giving you this form because they\n22.292\nCat. No. 10231X\nForm W-9 (Rev. 3-2024)\nPage 2\nForm W-9 (Rev. 3-2024)\nmust obtain your correct taxpayer identification number (TIN), which may be your social security number (SSN), individual taxpayer identification number (ITIN), adoption taxpayer identification number (ATIN), or employer identification number (EIN), to report on an information return the amount paid to you, or other amount reportable on an information return. Examples of information returns include, but are not limited to, the following.\nÂ· Form 1099-INT (interest earned or paid).\nÂ· Form 1099-DIV (dividends, including those from stocks or mutual funds).\nÂ· Form 1099-MISC (various types of income, prizes, awards, or gross proceeds).\nÂ· Form 1099-NEC (nonemployee compensation).\n. Form 1099-B (stock or mutual fund sales and certain other transactions by brokers).\nÂ· Form 1099-S (proceeds from real estate transactions).\nÂ· Form 1099-K (merchant card and third-party network transactions).\nÂ· Form 1098 (home mortgage interest), 1098-E (student loan interest), and 1098-T (tuition).\nÂ· Form 1099-C (canceled debt).\nÂ· Form 1099-A (acquisition or abandonment of secured property). Use Form W-9 only if you are a U.S. person (including a resident alien), to provide your correct TIN.\nCaution: If you don't return Form W-9 to the requester with a TIN, you might be subject to backup withholding. See What is backup withholding, later.\nBy signing the filled-out form, you:\n1. Certify that the TIN you are giving is correct (or you are waiting for a number to be issued);\n2. Certify that you are not subject to backup withholding; or\n3. Claim exemption from backup withholding if you are a U.S. exempt payee; and\n4. Certify to your non-foreign status for purposes of withholding under chapter 3 or 4 of the Code (if applicable); and\n5. Certify that FATCA code(s) entered on this form (if any) indicating that you are exempt from the FATCA reporting is correct. See What Is FATCA Reporting, later, for further information.\nNote: If you are a U.S. person and a requester gives you a form other than Form W-9 to request your TIN, you must use the requester's form if it is substantially similar to this Form W-9.\nDefinition of a U.S. person. For federal tax purposes, you are considered a U.S. person if you are:\nÂ· An individual who is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien;\n. A partnership, corporation, company, or association created or organized in the United States or under the laws of the United States;\nÂ· An estate (other than a foreign estate); or\nÂ· A domestic trust (as defined in Regulations section 301.7701-7).\nEstablishing U.S. status for purposes of chapter 3 and chapter 4 withholding. Payments made to foreign persons, including certain distributions, allocations of income, or transfers of sales proceeds, may be subject to withholding under chapter 3 or chapter 4 of the Code (sections 1441-1474). Under those rules, if a Form W-9 or other certification of non- foreign status has not been received, a withholding agent, transferee, or partnership (payor) generally applies presumption rules that may require the payor to withhold applicable tax from the recipient, owner, transferor, or partner (payee). See Pub. 515, Withholding of Tax on Nonresident Aliens and Foreign Entities.\nThe following persons must provide Form W-9 to the payor for purposes of establishing its non-foreign status.\n. In the case of a disregarded entity with a U.S. owner, the U.S. owner of the disregarded entity and not the disregarded entity.\n. In the case of a grantor trust with a U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner, generally, the U.S. grantor or other U.S. owner of the grantor trust and not the grantor trust.\n. In the case of a U.S. trust (other than a grantor trust), the U.S. trust and not the beneficiaries of the trust.\nSee Pub. 515 for more information on providing a Form W-9 or a certification of non-foreign status to avoid withholding.\nForeign person. If you are a foreign person or the U.S. branch of a foreign bank that has elected to be treated as a U.S. person (under Regulations section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv) or other applicable section for chapter 3 or 4 purposes), do not use Form W-9. Instead, use the appropriate Form W-8 or Form 8233 (see Pub. 515). If you are a qualified foreign pension fund under Regulations section 1.897(1)-1(d), or a partnership that is wholly owned by qualified foreign pension funds, that is treated as a non-foreign person for purposes of section 1445 withholding, do not use Form W-9. Instead, use Form W-8EXP (or other certification of non-foreign status).\nNonresident alien who becomes a resident alien. Generally, only a nonresident alien individual may use the terms of a tax treaty to reduce or eliminate U.S. tax on certain types of income. However, most tax treaties contain a provision known as a saving clause. Exceptions specified in the saving clause may permit an exemption from tax to continue for certain types of income even after the payee has otherwise become a U.S. resident alien for tax purposes.\nIf you are a U.S. resident alien who is relying on an exception contained in the saving clause of a tax treaty to claim an exemption from U.S. tax on certain types of income, you must attach a statement to Form W-9 that specifies the following five items.\n1. The treaty country. Generally, this must be the same treaty under which you claimed exemption from tax as a nonresident alien.\n2. The treaty article addressing the income.\n3. The article number (or location) in the tax treaty that contains the saving clause and its exceptions.\n4. The type and amount of income that qualifies for the exemption from tax.\n5. Sufficient facts to justify the exemption from tax under the terms of the treaty article.\nExample. Article 20 of the U.S .- China income tax treaty allows an exemption from tax for scholarship income received by a Chinese student temporarily present in the United States. Under U.S. law, this student will become a resident alien for tax purposes if their stay in the United States exceeds 5 calendar years. However, paragraph 2 of the first Protocol to the U.S .- China treaty (dated April 30, 1984) allows the provisions of Article 20 to continue to apply even after the Chinese student becomes a resident alien of the United States. A Chinese student who qualifies for this exception (under paragraph 2 of the first Protocol) and is relying on this exception to claim an exemption from tax on their scholarship or fellowship income would attach to Form W-9 a statement that includes the information described above to support that exemption.\nIf you are a nonresident alien or a foreign entity, give the requester the appropriate completed Form W-8 or Form 8233.\nBackup Withholding\nWhat is backup withholding? Persons making certain payments to you must under certain conditions withhold and pay to the IRS 24% of such payments. This is called \"backup withholding.\" Payments that may be subject to backup withholding include, but are not limited to, interest, tax-exempt interest, dividends, broker and barter exchange transactions, rents, royalties, nonemployee pay, payments made in settlement of payment card and third- party network transactions, and certain payments from fishing boat operators. Real estate transactions are not subject to backup withholding.\nYou will not be subject to backup withholding on payments you receive if you give the requester your correct TIN, make the proper certifications, and report all your taxable interest and dividends on your tax return.\nPayments you receive will be subject to backup withholding if:\n1. You do not furnish your TIN to the requester;\n2. You do not certify your TIN when required (see the instructions for Part II for details);\n3. The IRS tells the requester that you furnished an incorrect TIN;\n4. The IRS tells you that you are subject to backup withholding because you did not report all your interest and dividends on your tax return (for reportable interest and dividends only); or\n5. You do not certify to the requester that you are not subject to backup withholding, as described in item 4 under \"By signing the filled-out form\" above (for reportable interest and dividend accounts opened after 1983 only).\nEX 22.292\nPage 3\nForm W-9 (Rev. 3-2024)\nCertain payees and payments are exempt from backup withholding. See Exempt payee code, later, and the separate instructions for the Requester of Form W-9 for more information.\nSee also Establishing U.S. status for purposes of chapter 3 and chapter 4 withholding, earlier.\nWhat Is FATCA Reporting?\nThe Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) requires a participating foreign financial institution to report all U.S. account holders that are specified U.S. persons. Certain payees are exempt from FATCA reporting. See Exemption from FATCA reporting code, later, and the Instructions for the Requester of Form W-9 for more information.\nUpdating Your Information\nYou must provide updated information to any person to whom you claimed to be an exempt payee if you are no longer an exempt payee and anticipate receiving reportable payments in the future from this person. For example, you may need to provide updated information if you are a C corporation that elects to be an S corporation, or if you are no longer tax exempt. In addition, you must furnish a new Form W-9 if the name or TIN changes for the account, for example, if the grantor of a grantor trust dies.\nPenalties\nFailure to furnish TIN. If you fail to furnish your correct TIN to a requester, you are subject to a penalty of $50 for each such failure unless your failure is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect.\nCivil penalty for false information with respect to withholding. If you make a false statement with no reasonable basis that results in no backup withholding, you are subject to a $500 penalty.\nCriminal penalty for falsifying information. Willfully falsifying certifications or affirmations may subject you to criminal penalties including fines and/or imprisonment.\nMisuse of TINs. If the requester discloses or uses TINs in violation of federal law, the requester may be subject to civil and criminal penalties.\nSpecific Instructions\nLine 1\nYou must enter one of the following on this line; do not leave this line blank. The name should match the name on your tax return.\nIf this Form W-9 is for a joint account (other than an account maintained by a foreign financial institution (FFI)), list first, and then circle, the name of the person or entity whose number you entered in Part I of Form W-9. If you are providing Form W-9 to an FFI to document a joint account, each holder of the account that is a U.S. person must provide a Form W-9.\n. Individual. Generally, enter the name shown on your tax return. If you have changed your last name without informing the Social Security Administration (SSA) of the name change, enter your first name, the last name as shown on your social security card, and your new last name.\n1 . Note for ITIN applicant: Enter your individual name as it was entered on your Form W-7 application, line 1a. This should also be the same as the name you entered on the Form 1040 you filed with your application.\n. Sole proprietor. Enter your individual name as shown on your Form 1040 on line 1. Enter your business, trade, or \"doing business as\" (DBA) name on line 2.\n. Partnership, C corporation, S corporation, or LLC, other than a disregarded entity. Enter the entity's name as shown on the entity's tax return on line 1 and any business, trade, or DBA name on line 2.\n. Other entities. Enter your name as shown on required U.S. federal tax documents on line 1. This name should match the name shown on the charter or other legal document creating the entity. Enter any business, trade, or DBA name on line 2.\n. Disregarded entity. In general, a business entity that has a single owner, including an LLC, and is not a corporation, is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner (a disregarded entity). See Regulations section 301.7701-2(c)(2). A disregarded entity should check the appropriate box for the tax classification of its owner. Enter the owner's name on line 1. The name of the owner entered on line 1 should never be a disregarded entity. The name on line 1 should be the name shown on the income tax return on which the income should be reported. For\nexample, if a foreign LLC that is treated as a disregarded entity for U.S. federal tax purposes has a single owner that is a U.S. person, the U.S. owner's name is required to be provided on line 1. If the direct owner of the entity is also a disregarded entity, enter the first owner that is not disregarded for federal tax purposes. Enter the disregarded entity's name on line 2. If the owner of the disregarded entity is a foreign person, the owner must complete an appropriate Form W-8 instead of a Form W-9. This is the case even if the foreign person has a U.S. TIN.\nLine 2\nIf you have a business name, trade name, DBA name, or disregarded entity name, enter it on line 2.\nLine 3a\nCheck the appropriate box on line 3a for the U.S. federal tax classification of the person whose name is entered on line 1.

You must check the box on line 3b if you receive a Form W-8 (or documentary evidence) from any partner, owner, or beneficiary establishing foreign status or if you receive a Form W-9 from any partner, owner, or beneficiary that has checked the box on line 3b.\nNote: A partnership that provides a Form W-9 and checks box 3b may be required to complete Schedules K-2 and K-3 (Form 1065). For more information, see the Partnership Instructions for Schedules K-2 and K-3 (Form 1065).\nIf you are required to complete line 3b but fail to do so, you may not receive the information necessary to file a correct information return with the IRS or furnish a correct payee statement to your partners or beneficiaries. See, for example, sections 6698, 6722, and 6724 for penalties that may apply.\nLine 4 Exemptions\nIf you are exempt from backup withholding and/or FATCA reporting, enter in the appropriate space on line 4 any code(s) that may apply to you.\nExempt payee code.\n.

Or, you can go to www.irs.gov/OrderForms to place an order and have Form W-7 and/or Form SS-4 mailed to you within 15 business days.\nIf you are asked to complete Form W-9 but do not have a TIN, apply for a TIN and enter \"Applied For\" in the space for the TIN, sign and date the form, and give it to the requester. For interest and dividend payments, and certain payments made with respect to readily tradable instruments, you will generally have 60 days to get a TIN and give it to the requester before you are subject to backup withholding on payments. The 60-day rule does not apply to other types of payments. You will be subject to backup withholding on all such payments until you provide your TIN to the requester.\nNote: Entering \"Applied For\" means that you have already applied for a TIN or that you intend to apply for one soon. See also Establishing U.S. status for purposes of chapter 3 and chapter 4 withholding, earlier, for when you may instead be subject to withholding under chapter 3 or 4 of the Code.\nCaution: A disregarded U.S. entity that has a foreign owner must use the appropriate Form W-8.\n22.292\nCX\nPage 5\nForm W-9 (Rev. 3-2024)\nPart II.

An identity thief may use your SSN to get a job or may file a tax return using your SSN to receive a refund.\nTo reduce your risk:\n. Protect your SSN,\n. Ensure your employer is protecting your SSN, and\n. Be careful when choosing a tax return preparer.\nIf your tax records are affected by identity theft and you receive a notice from the IRS, respond right away to the name and phone number printed on the IRS notice or letter.\nIf your tax records are not currently affected by identity theft but you think you are at risk due to a lost or stolen purse or wallet, questionable credit card activity, or a questionable credit report, contact the IRS Identity Theft Hotline at 800-908-4490 or submit Form 14039.\nFor more information, see Pub. 5027, Identity Theft Information for Taxpayers.\nCX 22.292\nPage 6\nForm W-9 (Rev. 3-2024)\nVictims of identity theft who are experiencing economic harm or a systemic problem, or are seeking help in resolving tax problems that have not been resolved through normal channels, may be eligible for Taxpayer Advocate Service (TAS) assistance. You can reach TAS by calling the TAS toll-free case intake line at 877-777-4778 or TTY/TDD 800-829-4059.\nProtect yourself from suspicious emails or phishing schemes. Phishing is the creation and use of email and websites designed to mimic legitimate business emails and websites. The most common act is sending an email to a user falsely claiming to be an established legitimate enterprise in an attempt to scam the user into surrendering private information that will be used for identity theft.\nThe IRS does not initiate contacts with taxpayers via emails. Also, the IRS does not request personal detailed information through email or ask taxpayers for the PIN numbers, passwords, or similar secret access information for their credit card, bank, or other financial accounts.\nIf you receive an unsolicited email claiming to be from the IRS, forward this message to phishing@irs.gov. You may also report misuse of the IRS name, logo, or other IRS property to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) at 800-366-4484. You can forward suspicious emails to the Federal Trade Commission at spam@uce.gov or report them at www.ftc.gov/complaint. You can contact the FTC at www.ftc.gov/idtheft or 877-IDTHEFT (877-438-4338). If you have been the victim of identity theft, see www.IdentityTheft.gov and Pub. 5027.\nGo to www.irs.gov/IdentityTheft to learn more about identity theft and how to reduce your risk.\nPrivacy Act Notice\nSection 6109 of the Internal Revenue Code requires you to provide your correct TIN to persons (including federal agencies) who are required to file information returns with the IRS to report interest, dividends, or certain other income paid to you; mortgage interest you paid; the acquisition or abandonment of secured property; the cancellation of debt; or contributions you made to an IRA, Archer MSA, or HSA. The person collecting this form uses the information on the form to file information returns with the IRS, reporting the above information. Routine uses of this information include giving it to the Department of Justice for civil and criminal litigation and to cities, states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. commonwealths and territories for use in administering their laws. The information may also be disclosed to other countries under a treaty, to federal and state agencies to enforce civil and criminal laws, or to federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies to combat terrorism. You must provide your TIN whether or not you are required to file a tax return. Under section 3406, payors must generally withhold a percentage of taxable interest, dividends, and certain other payments to a payee who does not give a TIN to the payor. Certain penalties may also apply for providing false or fraudulent information.\n22.292\nERRORS AND OMISSIONS / COMPLIANCE AGREEMENT\nMICHAELS Loan #: 8000327681 MIN: 100053680003276816\nBORROWER(S): CORNELIU MICHAELS\nPROPERTY ADDRESS: 19806 78TH AVE SE, SNOHOMISH, WA 98296-7929\nLENDER: PRIMELENDING, A PLAINSCAPITAL COMPANY\nThe undersigned Borrower(s) for and in consideration of the above-referenced Lender funding the closing of this loan agrees, if requested by Lender or Closing Agent for Lender, to fully cooperate and adjust for clerical errors, any or all loan closing documentation if deemed necessary or desirable in the reasonable discretion of Lender to enable Lender to sell, convey, seek guaranty or market said loan to any entity, including but not limited to an investor, Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, Government National Mortgage Association, Federal Housing Authority or the Department of Veterans Affairs, or any Municipal Bonding Authority.\nThe undersigned Borrower(s) agree(s) to comply with all above noted requests by the above-referenced Lender within 30 days from date of mailing of said requests.

BORROWER'S PROMISE TO PAY\nIn return for a loan in the amount of U.S. $550, 000. 00 (the \"Principal\") that I have received from PRIMELENDING, A PLAINSCAPITAL COMPANY (the \"Lender\"), I promise to pay the Principal, plus interest, to the order of the Lender. I will make all payments under this Note in U.S. currency in the form of cash, check, money order, or other payment method accepted by Lender.\nI understand that the Lender may transfer this Note. The Lender or anyone who takes this Note by transfer and who is entitled to receive payments under this Note is called the \"Note Holder.\"\n1\n2. INTEREST\nInterest will be charged on unpaid Principal until the full amount of the Principal has been paid. I will pay interest at a yearly rate of 6. 990%.\nThe interest rate required by this Section 2 is the rate I will pay both before and after any default described in Section 6(B) of this Note.\n3. PAYMENTS\n(A) Time and Place of Payments\nI will pay principal and interest by making a payment every month. This amount is called my \"Monthly Payment.\"\nI will make my Monthly Payment on the 1ST day of each month beginning on DECEMBER 1, 2024. I will make these payments every month until I have paid all of the Principal and interest and any other charges described below that I may owe under this Note. Each Monthly Payment will be applied as of its scheduled due date and will be applied to interest before the Principal. If, on NOVEMBER 1, 2054, I still owe amounts under this Note, I will pay those amounts on that date, which is called the \"Maturity Date.\"\nI will make my Monthly Payments at 18111 PRESTON ROAD SUITE 900, DALLAS, TX 75252 or at a different place if required by the Note Holder.\n(B) Amount of Monthly Payments\nMy Monthly Payment will be in the amount of U.S. $3, 655. 47. This payment amount does not include any property taxes, insurance, or other charges that I may be required to pay each month.\n4. BORROWER'S RIGHT TO PREPAY\nI have the right to make payments of principal at any time before they are due. A payment of principal only\nMULTISTATE FIXED RATE NOTE -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT\nForm 3200 07/2021\nPage 1 of 4\nCX 25454.9\n8000327681\nis known as a \"Prepayment.\" When I make a Prepayment, I will notify the Note Holder in writing that I am doing so. I may not designate a payment as a Prepayment if I have not made all the Monthly Payments then due under this Note.\nI may make a full Prepayment or partial Prepayments without paying a Prepayment charge. The Note Holder will use my Prepayments to reduce the amount of Principal that I owe under this Note. However, the Note Holder may apply my Prepayment to the accrued and unpaid interest on the Prepayment amount, before applying my Prepayment to reduce the Principal amount of the Note. If I make a partial Prepayment, there will be no changes in the due date or in the amount of my Monthly Payment unless the Note Holder agrees in writing to those changes.\n5. LOAN CHARGES\nIf applicable law sets maximum loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted so that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the loan exceed the permitted limits, then (a) any such loan charge will be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit, and (b) any sums already collected from me that exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to me. The Note Holder may choose to make this refund by reducing the Principal I owe under this Note or by making a direct payment to me. If a refund reduces Principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial Prepayment.\n6. BORROWER'S FAILURE TO PAY AS REQUIRED\n(A) Late Charges for Overdue Payments\nIf the Note Holder has not received the full amount of any Monthly Payment by the end of 15 calendar days after the date it is due, I will pay a late charge to the Note Holder. The amount of the charge will be 5. 000% of my overdue Monthly Payment. I will pay this late charge promptly but only once on each late payment.\n(B) Default\nIf I do not pay the full amount of each Monthly Payment on the date it is due, I will be in default.\n(C) Notice of Default\nIf I am in default, the Note Holder may send me a written notice telling me that if I do not pay the overdue amount by a certain date, the Note Holder may require me to pay immediately the full amount of unpaid Principal, all the interest that I owe on that amount, and other charges due under this Note (the \"Default Balance\"). That date must be at least 30 days after the date on which the notice is mailed to me or delivered by other means.\n(D) No Waiver By Note Holder\nIf I am in default and the Note Holder does not require me to pay the Default Balance immediately as described above, the Note Holder will still have the right to do so if I continue to be in default or if I am in default at a later time.\n(E) Payment of Note Holder's Costs and Expenses\nIf the Note Holder has required me to pay the Default Balance immediately as described above, the Note Holder will have the right to be paid back by me for all of its costs and expenses in enforcing this Note to the extent not prohibited by applicable law. Those expenses include, for example, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.\n7. . GIVING OF NOTICES\n(A) Notice to Borrower\nMULTISTATE FIXED RATE NOTE -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT\nForm 3200 07/2021\nEX 25454.9\nPage 2 of 4\n8000327681\nUnless applicable law requires a different method, any notice that must be given to me under this Note will be given by delivering it, or by mailing it by first class mail, to me at the Property Address above or at a different address if I give the Note Holder a notice of my different address. I will promptly notify the Note Holder of any change to my physical address and of any change to my mailing address. Unless applicable law requires otherwise, notice may instead be sent by e-mail or other electronic communication if agreed to by me and the Note Holder in writing and if I have provided the Note Holder with my current e-mail address or other electronic address. If I have agreed with the Note Holder that notice may be given by e-mail or other electronic communication, I will promptly notify the Note Holder of any changes to my e-mail address or other electronic address.\n(B) Notice to Note Holder\nAny notice that I must give to the Note Holder under this Note will be delivered by first class mail to the Note Holder at the address stated in Section 3(A) above or at a different address if I am given a notice of that different address.\n8. OBLIGATIONS OF PERSONS UNDER THIS NOTE\nIf more than one person signs this Note, each person is fully and personally obligated to keep all of the promises made in this Note, including the promise to pay the full amount owed. Any person who is a guarantor, surety, or endorser of this Note is also obligated to do these things. Any person who takes over these obligations, including the obligations of a guarantor, surety, or endorser of this Note, is also obligated to keep all of the promises made in this Note. The Note Holder may enforce its rights under this Note against each person individually or against all of us together. This means that any one of us may be required to pay all of the amounts owed under this Note.\n9. WAIVERS\nI and any other person who has obligations under this Note waive the rights of Presentment and Notice of Dishonor. \"Presentment\" means the right to require the Note Holder to demand payment of amounts due. \"Notice of Dishonor\" means the right to require the Note Holder to give notice to other persons that amounts due have not been paid.\n10. UNIFORM SECURED NOTE\nThis Note is a uniform instrument with limited variations in some jurisdictions. In addition to the protections given to the Note Holder under this Note, a Mortgage, Mortgage Deed, Deed of Trust, or Security Deed (the \"Security Instrument\"), dated the same date as this Note, protects the Note Holder from possible losses that might result if I do not keep the promises that I make in this Note. That Security Instrument also describes how and under what conditions I may be required to make immediate payment of all amounts I owe under this Note. Some of those conditions are described as follows:\nIf all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender's prior written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, Lender will not exercise this option if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.\nIf Lender exercises this option, Lender will give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice will provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 16 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to, or upon, the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without further notice or\nMULTISTATE FIXED RATE NOTE -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT\nForm 3200 07/2021\nPage 3 of 4\n[x] 25454.9\n8000327681\ndemand on Borrower and will be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing such remedies, including, but not limited to: (a) reasonable attorneys' fees and costs; (b) property inspection and valuation fees; and (c) other fees incurred to protect Lender's Interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument. 1\nWITNESS THE HAND(S) AND SEAL(S) OF THE UNDERSIGNED.\n- BORROWER - CORNELIU MICHAELS\n[Sign Original Only]\nIndividual Loan Originator: SHARON CROCKETT, NMLSR ID: 114230\nLoan Originator Organization: PRIMELENDING, A PLAINSCAPITAL COMPANY, NMLSR ID: 13649\nPAY TO THE ORDER OF WITHOUT RECOURSE PrimeLending, A PlainsCapital Company\nBY:\nPRINTED NAME:\nTITLE:\n7\nMULTISTATE FIXED RATE NOTE -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT CX :selected: 25454.9\nForm 3200 07/2021\nPage 4 of 4\nCertified to be a true and correct copy of the original OCTOBER 8 2020/ NotCHICAGO TITLE\nNOTE\nMICHAELS Loan #: 8000327681 MIN: 100053680003276816\nEVERETT, [City]\nWASHINGTON [State]\n19806 78TH AVE SE, SNOHOMISH, WA 98296-7929 [Property Address]\n1.

All of the foregoing is referred to in this Security Instrument as the \"Property.\"\nBORROWER REPRESENTS, WARRANTS, COVENANTS, AND AGREES that: (i) Borrower lawfully owns and possesses the Property conveyed in this Security Instrument in fee simple or lawfully has the right to use and occupy the Property under a leasehold estate; (ii) Borrower has the right to grant and convey the Property or Borrower's leasehold interest in the Property; and (iii) the Property is unencumbered, and not subject to any other ownership interest in the Property, except for encumbrances and ownership interests of record. Borrower warrants generally the title to the Property and covenants and agrees to defend the title to the Property against all claims and demands, subject to any encumbrances and ownership interests of record as of Loan closing.\nTHIS SECURITY INSTRUMENT combines uniform covenants for national use with limited variations and non-uniform covenants that reflect specific Washington state requirements to constitute a uniform security instrument covering real property.\nUNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender covenant and agree as follows:\n1. Payment of Principal, Interest, Escrow Items, Prepayment Charges, and Late Charges. Borrower will pay each Periodic Payment when due. Borrower will also pay any prepayment charges and late charges due under the Note, and any other amounts due under this Security Instrument. Payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument must be made in U.S. currency. If any check or other instrument received by Lender as payment under the Note or this Security Instrument is returned to Lender unpaid, Lender may require that any or all subsequent payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument be made in one or more of the following forms, as selected by Lender: (a) cash; (b) money order; (c) certified check, bank check, treasurer's check, or cashier's check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a U.S. federal agency, instrumentality, or entity; or (d) Electronic Fund Transfer.\nPayments are deemed received by Lender when received at the location designated in the Note or at such other location as may be designated by Lender in accordance with the notice provisions in Section 16. Lender may accept or return any Partial Payments in its sole discretion pursuant to Section 2.\nAny offset or claim that Borrower may have now or in the future against Lender will not relieve Borrower from making the full amount of all payments due under the Note and this Security Instrument or performing the covenants and agreements secured by this Security Instrument.\n2. Acceptance and Application of Payments or Proceeds.\n(a) Acceptance and Application of Partial Payments. Lender may accept and either apply or hold in suspense Partial Payments in its sole discretion in accordance with this Section 2. Lender is not obligated\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT [*] 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 4 of 18\n8000327681\nto accept any Partial Payments or to apply any Partial Payments at the time such payments are accepted, and also is not obligated to pay interest on such unapplied funds. Lender may hold such unapplied funds until Borrower makes payment sufficient to cover a full Periodic Payment, at which time the amount of the full Periodic Payment will be applied to the Loan. If Borrower does not make such a payment within a reasonable period of time, Lender will either apply such funds in accordance with this Section 2 or return them to Borrower. If not applied earlier, Partial Payments will be credited against the total amount due under the Loan in calculating the amount due in connection with any foreclosure proceeding, payoff request, loan modification, or reinstatement. Lender may accept any payment insufficient to bring the Loan current without waiver of any rights under this Security Instrument or prejudice to its rights to refuse such payments in the future.\n(b) Order of Application of Partial Payments and Periodic Payments. Except as otherwise described in this Section 2, if Lender applies a payment, such payment will be applied to each Periodic Payment in the order in which it became due, beginning with the oldest outstanding Periodic Payment, as follows: first to interest and then to principal due under the Note, and finally to Escrow Items. If all outstanding Periodic Payments then due are paid in full, any payment amounts remaining may be applied to late charges and to any amounts then due under this Security Instrument. If all sums then due under the Note and this Security Instrument are paid in full, any remaining payment amount may be applied, in Lender's sole discretion, to a future Periodic Payment or to reduce the principal balance of the Note.\nIf Lender receives a payment from Borrower in the amount of one or more Periodic Payments and the amount of any late charge due for a delinquent Periodic Payment, the payment may be applied to the delinquent payment and the late charge.\nWhen applying payments, Lender will apply such payments in accordance with Applicable Law.\n(c) Voluntary Prepayments. Voluntary prepayments will be applied as described in the Note.\n(d) No Change to Payment Schedule. Any application of payments, insurance proceeds, or Miscellaneous Proceeds to principal due under the Note will not extend or postpone the due date, or change the amount, of the Periodic Payments.\n. 3. Funds for Escrow Items.\n(a) Escrow Requirement; Escrow Items. Borrower must pay to Lender on the day Periodic Payments are due under the Note, until the Note is paid in full, a sum of money to provide for payment of amounts due for all Escrow Items (the \"Funds\"). The amount of the Funds required to be paid each month may change during the term of the Loan. Borrower must promptly furnish to Lender all notices or invoices of amounts to be paid under this Section 3.\n(b) Payment of Funds; Waiver. Borrower must pay Lender the Funds for Escrow Items unless Lender waives this obligation in writing. Lender may waive this obligation for any Escrow Item at any time. In the event of such waiver, Borrower must pay directly, when and where payable, the amounts due for any Escrow Items subject to the waiver. If Lender has waived the requirement to pay Lender the Funds for any or all Escrow Items, Lender may require Borrower to provide proof of direct payment of those items within such time period as Lender may require. Borrower's obligation to make such timely payments and to provide proof of payment is deemed to be a covenant and agreement of Borrower under this Security Instrument. If Borrower is obligated to pay Escrow Items directly pursuant to a waiver, and Borrower fails to pay timely the amount due for an Escrow Item, Lender may exercise its rights under Section 9 to pay such amount and Borrower will be obligated to repay to Lender any such amount in accordance with Section 9.\nLender may withdraw the waiver as to any or all Escrow Items at any time by giving a notice in accordance with Section 16; upon such withdrawal, Borrower must pay to Lender all Funds for such Escrow Items, and in such amounts, that are then required under this Section 3.\n(c) Amount of Funds; Application of Funds. Lender may, at any time, collect and hold Funds in an amount up to, but not in excess of, the maximum amount a lender can require under RESPA. Lender will estimate the amount of Funds due in accordance with Applicable Law.\nWASHINGTON-Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 5 of 18\n8000327681\nThe Funds will be held in an institution whose deposits are insured by a U.S. federal agency, instrumentality, or entity (including Lender, if Lender is an institution whose deposits are so insured) or in any Federal Home Loan Bank. Lender will apply the Funds to pay the Escrow Items no later than the time specified under RESPA. Lender may not charge Borrower for: (i) holding and applying the Funds; (ii) annually analyzing the escrow account; or (iii) verifying the Escrow Items, unless Lender pays Borrower interest on the Funds and Applicable Law permits Lender to make such a charge. Unless Lender and Borrower agree in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on the Funds, Lender will not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on the Funds. Lender will give to Borrower, without charge, an annual accounting of the Funds as required by RESPA.\n(d) Surplus; Shortage and Deficiency of Funds. In accordance with RESPA, if there is a surplus of Funds held in escrow, Lender will account to Borrower for such surplus. If Borrower's Periodic Payment is delinquent by more than 30 days, Lender may retain the surplus in the escrow account for the payment of the Escrow Items unless prohibited by Applicable Law. If there is a shortage or deficiency of Funds held in escrow, Lender will notify Borrower and Borrower will pay to Lender the amount necessary to make up the shortage or deficiency in accordance with RESPA.\nUpon payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender will promptly refund to Borrower any Funds held by Lender.\n4. Charges; Liens. Borrower must pay (a) all taxes, assessments, charges, fines, and impositions attributable to the Property which have priority or may attain priority over this Security Instrument, (b) leasehold payments or ground rents on the Property, if any, and (c) Community Association Dues, Fees, and Assessments, if any. If any of these items are Escrow Items, Borrower will pay them in the manner provided in Section 3.\nBorrower must promptly discharge any lien that has priority or may attain priority over this Security Instrument unless Borrower: (aa) agrees in writing to the payment of the obligation secured by the lien in a manner acceptable to Lender, but only so long as Borrower is performing under such agreement; (bb) contests the lien in good faith by, or defends against enforcement of the lien in, legal proceedings which Lender determines, in its sole discretion, operate to prevent the enforcement of the lien while those proceedings are pending, but only until such proceedings are concluded; or (cc) secures from the holder of the lien an agreement satisfactory to Lender that subordinates the lien to this Security Instrument (collectively, the \"Required Actions\"). If Lender determines that any part of the Property is subject to a lien that has priority or may attain priority over this Security Instrument and Borrower has not taken any of the Required Actions in regard to such lien, Lender may give Borrower a notice identifying the lien. Within 10 days after the date on which that notice is given, Borrower must satisfy the lien or take one or more of the Required Actions.\n5. Property Insurance.\n(a) Insurance Requirement; Coverages. Borrower must keep the improvements now existing or subsequently erected on the Property insured against loss by fire, hazards included within the term \"extended coverage,\" and any other hazards including, but not limited to, earthquakes, winds, and floods, for which Lender requires insurance. Borrower must maintain the types of insurance Lender requires in the amounts (including deductible levels) and for the periods that Lender requires. What Lender requires pursuant to the preceding sentences can change during the term of the Loan, and may exceed any minimum coverage required by Applicable Law. Borrower may choose the insurance carrier providing the insurance, subject to Lender's right to disapprove Borrower's choice, which right will not be exercised unreasonably.\n(b) Failure to Maintain Insurance. If Lender has a reasonable basis to believe that Borrower has failed to maintain any of the required insurance coverages described above, Lender may obtain insurance coverage, at Lender's option and at Borrower's expense. Unless required by Applicable Law, Lender is under no obligation to advance premiums for, or to seek to reinstate, any prior lapsed coverage obtained by Borrower. Lender is under no obligation to purchase any particular type or amount of coverage and may\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 6 of 18\n8000327681\nselect the provider of such insurance in its sole discretion. Before purchasing such coverage, Lender will notify Borrower if required to do so under Applicable Law. Any such coverage will insure Lender, but might not protect Borrower, Borrower's equity in the Property, or the contents of the Property, against any risk, hazard, or liability and might provide greater or lesser coverage than was previously in effect, but not exceeding the coverage required under Section 5(a). Borrower acknowledges that the cost of the insurance coverage so obtained may significantly exceed the cost of insurance that Borrower could have obtained. Any amounts disbursed by Lender for costs associated with reinstating Borrower's insurance policy or with placing new insurance under this Section 5 will become additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts will bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and will be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.\n(c) Insurance Policies. All insurance policies required by Lender and renewals of such policies: (i) will be subject to Lender's right to disapprove such policies; (ii) must include a standard mortgage clause; and (iii) must name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee. Lender will have the right to hold the policies and renewal certificates. If Lender requires, Borrower will promptly give to Lender proof of paid premiums and renewal notices. If Borrower obtains any form of insurance coverage, not otherwise required by Lender, for damage to, or destruction of, the Property, such policy must include a standard mortgage clause and must name Lender as mortgagee and/or as an additional loss payee.\n(d) Proof of Loss; Application of Proceeds. In the event of loss, Borrower must give prompt notice to the insurance carrier and Lender. Lender may make proof of loss if not made promptly by Borrower. Any insurance proceeds, whether or not the underlying insurance was required by Lender, will be applied to restoration or repair of the Property, if Lender deems the restoration or repair to be economically feasible and determines that Lender's security will not be lessened by such restoration or repair.\nIf the Property is to be repaired or restored, Lender will disburse from the insurance proceeds any initial amounts that are necessary to begin the repair or restoration, subject to any restrictions applicable to Lender. During the subsequent repair and restoration period, Lender will have the right to hold such insurance proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect such Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender's satisfaction (which may include satisfying Lender's minimum eligibility requirements for persons repairing the Property, including, but not limited to, licensing, bond, and insurance requirements) provided that such inspection must be undertaken promptly. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed, depending on the size of the repair or restoration, the terms of the repair agreement, and whether Borrower is in Default on the Loan. Lender may make such disbursements directly to Borrower, to the person repairing or restoring the Property, or payable jointly to both. Lender will not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such insurance proceeds unless Lender and Borrower agree in writing or Applicable Law requires otherwise. Fees for public adjusters, or other third parties, retained by Borrower will not be paid out of the insurance proceeds and will be the sole obligation of Borrower.\nIf Lender deems the restoration or repair not to be economically feasible or Lender's security would be lessened by such restoration or repair, the insurance proceeds will be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such insurance proceeds will be applied in the order that Partial Payments are applied in Section 2(b).\n(e) Insurance Settlements; Assignment of Proceeds. If Borrower abandons the Property, Lender may file, negotiate, and settle any available insurance claim and related matters. If Borrower does not respond within 30 days to a notice from Lender that the insurance carrier has offered to settle a claim, then Lender may negotiate and settle the claim. The 30-day period will begin when the notice is given. In either event, or if Lender acquires the Property under Section 26 or otherwise, Borrower is unconditionally assigning to Lender (i) Borrower's rights to any insurance proceeds in an amount not to exceed the amounts unpaid under the Note and this Security Instrument, and (ii) any other of Borrower's rights (other than the right to any refund of unearned premiums paid by Borrower) under all insurance policies covering the Property, to the extent that such rights are applicable to the coverage of the Property. If Lender files,\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 7 of 18\n8000327681\nnegotiates, or settles a claim, Borrower agrees that any insurance proceeds may be made payable directly to Lender without the need to include Borrower as an additional loss payee. Lender may use the insurance proceeds either to repair or restore the Property (as provided in Section 5(d)) or to pay amounts unpaid under the Note or this Security Instrument, whether or not then due.\n6. Occupancy. Borrower must occupy, establish, and use the Property as Borrower's principal residence within 60 days after the execution of this Security Instrument and must continue to occupy the Property as Borrower's principal residence for at least one year after the date of occupancy, unless Lender otherwise agrees in writing, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, or unless extenuating circumstances exist that are beyond Borrower's control.\n7. Preservation, Maintenance, and Protection of the Property; Inspections. Borrower will not destroy, damage, or impair the Property, allow the Property to deteriorate, or commit waste on the Property. Whether or not Borrower is residing in the Property, Borrower must maintain the Property in order to prevent the Property from deteriorating or decreasing in value due to its condition. Unless Lender determines pursuant to Section 5 that repair or restoration is not economically feasible, Borrower will promptly repair the Property if damaged to avoid further deterioration or damage.\nIf insurance or condemnation proceeds are paid to Lender in connection with damage to, or the taking of, the Property, Borrower will be responsible for repairing or restoring the Property only if Lender has released proceeds for such purposes. Lender may disburse proceeds for the repairs and restoration in a single payment or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed, depending on the size of the repair or restoration, the terms of the repair agreement, and whether Borrower is in Default on the Loan. Lender may make such disbursements directly to Borrower, to the person repairing or restoring the Property, or payable jointly to both. If the insurance or condemnation proceeds are not sufficient to repair or restore the Property, Borrower remains obligated to complete such repair or restoration.\nSubject to Applicable Law, Lender may make reasonable entries upon and inspections of the Property and/or may inspect the interior of the improvements on the Property.\n8. Borrower's Loan Application. Borrower will be in Default if, during the Loan application process, Borrower or any persons or entities acting at Borrower's direction or with Borrower's knowledge or consent gave materially false, misleading, or inaccurate information or statements to Lender (or failed to provide Lender with material information) in connection with the Loan, including, but not limited to, overstating Borrower's income or assets, understating or failing to provide documentation of Borrower's debt obligations and liabilities, and misrepresenting Borrower's occupancy or intended occupancy of the Property as Borrower's principal residence.\n9. Protection of Lender's Interest in the Property and Rights Under this Security Instrument.\n(a) Protection of Lender's Interest. If: (i) Borrower fails to perform the covenants and agreements contained in this Security Instrument; (ii) there is a legal proceeding or government order that might . significantly affect Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument (such as a proceeding in bankruptcy, probate, for condemnation or forfeiture, for enforcement of a lien that has priority or may attain priority over this Security Instrument, or to enforce laws or regulations); or (iii) Lender reasonably believes that Borrower has abandoned the Property, then Lender may do and pay for whatever is reasonable or appropriate to protect Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument, including protecting and/or assessing the value of the Property, and securing and/or repairing the Property. Lender's actions may include, but are not limited to: (I) paying any sums secured by a lien that has priority or may attain priority over this Security Instrument; (II) appearing in court; and (III) paying: (A) reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, and other fees and costs associated with the enforcement of this Security Instrument, including but not limited to foreclosure trustee and sheriff's fees and costs; (B) property inspection and valuation fees, unless prohibited by Applicable Law; and (C) other fees incurred for the purpose of protecting Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument, including its secured position in a bankruptcy proceeding. Securing the Property includes, but is not limited to, exterior and interior inspections of the Property, entering the Property to make repairs, changing locks, replacing or\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 8 of 18\n8000327681\nboarding up doors and windows, draining water from pipes, eliminating building or other code violations or dangerous conditions, and having utilities turned on or off. Although Lender may take action under this Section 9, Lender is not required to do so and is not under any duty or obligation to do so. Lender will not be liable for not taking any or all actions authorized under this Section 9.\n(b) Avoiding Foreclosure; Mitigating Losses. If Borrower is in Default, Lender may work with Borrower to avoid foreclosure and/or mitigate Lender's potential losses, but is not obligated to do so unless required by Applicable Law. Lender may take reasonable actions to evaluate Borrower for available alternatives to foreclosure, including, but not limited to, obtaining credit reports, title reports, title insurance, property valuations, subordination agreements, and third-party approvals. Borrower authorizes and consents to these actions. Any costs associated with such loss mitigation activities may be paid by Lender and recovered from Borrower as described below in Section 9(c), unless prohibited by Applicable Law.\n(c) Additional Amounts Secured. Any amounts disbursed by Lender under this Section 9 will become additional debt of Borrower secured by this Security Instrument. These amounts may bear interest at the Note rate from the date of disbursement and will be payable, with such interest, upon notice from Lender to Borrower requesting payment.\n(d) Leasehold Terms. If this Security Instrument is on a leasehold, Borrower will comply with all the provisions of the lease. Borrower will not surrender the leasehold estate and interests conveyed or terminate or cancel the ground lease. Borrower will not, without the express written consent of Lender, alter or amend the ground lease. If Borrower acquires fee title to the Property, the leasehold and the fee title, will not merge unless Lender agrees to the merger in writing.\n10. Assignment of Rents.\n(a) Assignment of Rents. If the Property is leased to, used by, or occupied by a third party ('Tenant\"), Borrower is unconditionally assigning and transferring to Lender any Rents, regardless of to whom the Rents are payable. Borrower authorizes Lender to collect the Rents, and agrees that each Tenant will pay the Rents to Lender. However, Borrower will receive the Rents until (i) Lender has given Borrower notice of Default pursuant to Section 26, and (ii) Lender has given notice to the Tenant that the Rents are to be paid to Lender. This Section 10 constitutes an absolute assignment and not an assignment for additional security only.\n(b) Notice of Default. If Lender gives notice of Default to Borrower: (i) all Rents received by Borrower must be held by Borrower as trustee for the benefit of Lender only, to be applied to the sums secured by the Security Instrument; (ii) Lender will be entitled to collect and receive all of the Rents; (iii) Borrower agrees to instruct each Tenant that Tenant is to pay all Rents due and unpaid to Lender upon Lender's written demand to the Tenant; (iv) Borrower will ensure that each Tenant pays all Rents due to Lender and will take whatever action is necessary to collect such Rents if not paid to Lender; (v) unless Applicable Law provides otherwise, all Rents collected by Lender will be applied first to the costs of taking control of and managing the Property and collecting the Rents, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, receiver's fees, premiums on receiver's bonds, repair and maintenance costs, insurance premiums, taxes, assessments, and other charges on the Property, and then to any other sums secured by this Security Instrument; (vi) Lender, or any judicially appointed receiver, will be liable to account for only those Rents actually received; and (vii) Lender will be entitled to have a receiver appointed to take possession of and manage the Property and collect the Rents and profits derived from the Property without any showing as to the inadequacy of the Property as security.\n(c) Funds Paid by Lender. If the Rents are not sufficient to cover the costs of taking control of and managing the Property and of collecting the Rents, any funds paid by Lender for such purposes will become indebtedness of Borrower to Lender secured by this Security Instrument pursuant to Section 9.\n(d) Limitation on Collection of Rents. Borrower may not collect any of the Rents more than one month in advance of the time when the Rents become due, except for security or similar deposits.\n(e) No Other Assignment of Rents. Borrower represents, warrants, covenants, and agrees that\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT (EX) 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 9 of 18\n8000327681\nBorrower has not signed any prior assignment of the Rents, will not make any further assignment of the Rents, and has not performed, and will not perform, any act that could prevent Lender from exercising its rights under this Security Instrument.\n(f) Control and Maintenance of the Property. Unless required by Applicable Law, Lender, or a receiver appointed under Applicable Law, is not obligated to enter upon, take control of, or maintain the Property before or after giving notice of Default to Borrower. However, Lender, or a receiver appointed under Applicable Law, may do so at any time when Borrower is in Default, subject to Applicable Law.\n(g) Additional Provisions. Any application of the Rents will not cure or waive any Default or invalidate any other right or remedy of Lender. This Section 10 does not relieve Borrower of Borrower's obligations under Section 6.\nThis Section 10 will terminate when all the sums secured by this Security Instrument are paid in full.\n11. Mortgage Insurance.\n(a) Payment of Premiums; Substitution of Policy; Loss Reserve; Protection of Lender. If Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan, Borrower will pay the premiums required to maintain the Mortgage Insurance in effect. If Borrower was required to make separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, and (i) the Mortgage Insurance coverage required by Lender ceases for any reason to be available from the mortgage insurer that previously provided such insurance, or (ii) Lender determines in its sole discretion that such mortgage insurer is no longer eligible to provide the Mortgage Insurance coverage required by Lender, Borrower will pay the premiums required to obtain coverage substantially equivalent to the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, at a cost substantially equivalent to the cost to Borrower of the Mortgage Insurance previously in effect, from an alternate mortgage insurer selected by Lender.\nIf substantially equivalent Mortgage Insurance coverage is not available, Borrower will continue to pay to Lender the amount of the separately designated payments that were due when the insurance coverage ceased to be in effect. Lender will accept, use, and retain these payments as a non-refundable loss reserve in lieu of Mortgage Insurance. Such loss reserve will be non-refundable, even when the Loan is paid in full, and Lender will not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such loss reserve.\nLender will no longer require loss reserve payments if Mortgage Insurance coverage (in the amount and for the period that Lender requires) provided by an insurer selected by Lender again becomes available, is obtained, and Lender requires separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance.\nIf Lender required Mortgage Insurance as a condition of making the Loan and Borrower was required to make separately designated payments toward the premiums for Mortgage Insurance, Borrower will pay the premiums required to maintain Mortgage Insurance in effect, or to provide a non-refundable loss reserve, until Lender's requirement for Mortgage Insurance ends in accordance with any written agreement between Borrower and Lender providing for such termination or until termination is required by Applicable Law. Nothing in this Section 11 affects Borrower's obligation to pay interest at the Note rate.\n(b) Mortgage Insurance Agreements. Mortgage Insurance reimburses Lender for certain losses Lender may incur if Borrower does not repay the Loan as agreed. Borrower is not a party to the Mortgage Insurance policy or coverage.\nMortgage insurers evaluate their total risk on all such insurance in force from time to time, and may enter into agreements with other parties that share or modify their risk, or reduce losses. These agreements may require the mortgage insurer to make payments using any source of funds that the mortgage insurer may have available (which may include funds obtained from Mortgage Insurance premiums).\nAs a result of these agreements, Lender, another insurer, any reinsurer, any other entity, or any affiliate of any of the foregoing, may receive (directly or indirectly) amounts that derive from (or might be characterized as) a portion of Borrower's payments for Mortgage Insurance, in exchange for sharing or\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\n(EX] 25327.11\nPage 10 of 18\n8000327681\nmodifying the mortgage insurer's risk, or reducing losses. Any such agreements will not: (i) affect the amounts that Borrower has agreed to pay for Mortgage Insurance, or any other terms of the Loan; (ii) increase the amount Borrower will owe for Mortgage Insurance; (iii) entitle Borrower to any refund; or (iv) affect the rights Borrower has, if any, with respect to the Mortgage Insurance under the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998 (12 U.S.C. Â§ 4901 et seq.), as it may be amended from time to time, or any additional or successor federal legislation or regulation that governs the same subject matter (\"HPA\"). These rights under the HPA may include the right to receive certain disclosures, to request and obtain cancellation of the Mortgage Insurance, to have the Mortgage Insurance terminated automatically, and/or to receive a refund 'of any Mortgage Insurance premiums that were unearned at the time of such cancellation or termination.\n12. Assignment and Application of Miscellaneous Proceeds; Forfeiture.\n(a) Assignment of Miscellaneous Proceeds. Borrower is unconditionally assigning the right to receive all Miscellaneous Proceeds to Lender and agrees that such amounts will be paid to Lender.\n(b) Application of Miscellaneous Proceeds upon Damage to Property. If the Property is damaged, any Miscellaneous Proceeds will be applied to restoration or repair of the Property, if Lender deems the restoration or repair to be economically feasible and Lender's security will not be lessened by such restoration or repair. During such repair and restoration period, Lender will have the right to hold such Miscellaneous Proceeds until Lender has had an opportunity to inspect the Property to ensure the work has been completed to Lender's satisfaction (which may include satisfying Lender's minimum eligibility requirements for persons repairing the Property, including, but not limited to, licensing, bond, and insurance requirements) provided that such inspection must be undertaken promptly. Lender may pay for the repairs and restoration in a single disbursement or in a series of progress payments as the work is completed, depending on the size of the repair or restoration, the terms of the repair agreement, and whether Borrower is in Default on the Loan. Lender may make such disbursements directly to Borrower, to the person repairing or restoring the Property, or payable jointly to both. Unless Lender and Borrower agree in writing or Applicable Law requires interest to be paid on such Miscellaneous Proceeds, Lender will not be required to pay Borrower any interest or earnings on such Miscellaneous Proceeds. If Lender deems the restoration or repair not to be economically feasible or Lender's security would be lessened by such restoration or repair, the Miscellaneous Proceeds will be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower. Such Miscellaneous Proceeds will be applied in the order that Partial Payments are applied in Section 2(b).\n(c) Application of Miscellaneous Proceeds upon Condemnation, Destruction, or Loss in Value of the Property. In the event of a total taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property, all of the Miscellaneous Proceeds will be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, with the excess, if any, paid to Borrower.\nIn the event of a partial taking, destruction, or loss in value of the Property (each, a \"Partial Devaluation\") where the fair market value of the Property immediately before the Partial Devaluation is equal to or greater than the amount of the sum's secured by this Security Instrument immediately before the Partial Devaluation, a percentage of the Miscellaneous Proceeds will be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing. The amount of the Miscellaneous Proceeds that will be so applied is determined by multiplying the total amount of the Miscellaneous Proceeds by a percentage calculated by taking (i) the total amount of the sums secured immediately before the Partial Devaluation, and dividing it by (ii) the fair market value of the Property immediately before the Partial Devaluation. Any balance of the Miscellaneous Proceeds will be paid to Borrower.\nIn the event of a Partial Devaluation where the fair market value of the Property immediately before the Partial Devaluation is less than the amount of the sums secured immediately before the Partial Devaluation, all of the Miscellaneous Proceeds will be applied to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not the sums are then due, unless Borrower and Lender otherwise agree in writing.\n(d) Settlement of Claims. Lender is authorized to collect and apply the Miscellaneous Proceeds WASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT Form 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22) EXI 25327.11\nPage 11 of 18\n8000327681\neither to the sums secured by this Security Instrument, whether or not then due, or to restoration or repair of the Property, if Borrower (i) abandons the Property, or (ii) fails to respond to Lender within 30 days after the date Lender notifies Borrower that the Opposing Party (as defined in the next sentence) offers to settle a claim for damages. \"Opposing Party\" means the third party that owes Borrower the Miscellaneous Proceeds or the party against whom Borrower has a right of action in regard to the Miscellaneous Proceeds.\n(e) Proceeding Affecting Lender's Interest in the Property. Borrower will be in Default if any action or proceeding begins, whether civil or criminal, that, in Lender's judgment, could result in forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender's interest in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. Borrower can cure such a Default and, if acceleration has occurred, reinstate as provided in Section 20, by causing the action or proceeding to be dismissed with a ruling that, in Lender's judgment, precludes forfeiture of the Property or other material impairment of Lender's interest in the Property or rights under this Security Instrument. Borrower is unconditionally assigning to Lender the proceeds of any award or claim for damages that are attributable to the impairment of Lender's interest in the Property, which proceeds will be paid to Lender. All Miscellaneous Proceeds that are not applied to restoration or repair of the Property will be applied in the order that Partial Payments are applied in Section 2(b).\n13. Borrower Not Released; Forbearance by Lender Not a Waiver. Borrower or any Successor in Interest of Borrower will not be released from liability under this Security Instrument if Lender extends the time for payment or modifies the amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument. Lender will not be required to commence proceedings against any Successor in Interest of Borrower, or to refuse to extend time for payment or otherwise modify amortization of the sums secured by this Security Instrument, by reason of any demand made by the original Borrower or any Successors in Interest of Borrower. Any forbearance by Lender in exercising any right or remedy including, without limitation, Lender's acceptance of payments from third persons, entities, or Successors in Interest of Borrower or in amounts less than the amount then due, will not be a waiver of, or preclude the exercise of, any right or remedy by Lender.\n14. Joint and Several Liability; Signatories; Successors and Assigns Bound. Borrower's obligations and liability under this Security Instrument will be joint and several. However, any Borrower who signs this Security Instrument but does not sign the Note: (a) signs this Security Instrument to mortgage, grant, and convey such Borrower's interest in the Property under the terms of this Security Instrument; (b) signs this Security Instrument to waive any applicable inchoate rights such as dower and curtesy and any available homestead exemptions; (c) signs this Security Instrument to assign any Miscellaneous Proceeds, Rents, or other earnings from the Property to Lender; (d) is not personally obligated to pay the sums due under the Note or this Security Instrument; and (e) agrees that Lender and any other Borrower can agree to extend, modify, forbear, or make any accommodations with regard to the terms of the Note or this Security Instrument without such Borrower's consent and without affecting such Borrower's obligations under this Security Instrument.\nSubject to the provisions of Section 19, any Successor in Interest of Borrower who assumes Borrower's obligations under this Security Instrument in writing, and is approved by Lender, will obtain all of Borrower's rights, obligations, and benefits under this Security Instrument. Borrower will not be released from Borrower's obligations and liability under this Security Instrument unless Lender agrees to such release in writing.\n15. Loan Charges.\n(a) Tax and Flood Determination Fees. Lender may require Borrower to pay (i) a one-time charge for a real estate tax verification and/or reporting service used by Lender in connection with this Loan, and (ii) either (A) a one-time charge for flood zone determination, certification, and tracking services, or (B) a one- time charge for flood zone determination and certification services and subsequent charges each time remappings or similar changes occur that reasonably might affect such determination or certification. Borrower will also be responsible for the payment of any fees imposed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or any successor agency, at any time during the Loan term, in connection with any flood zone determinations.\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT EXI 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 12 of 18\n1\n8000327681\n(b) Default Charges. If permitted under Applicable Law, Lender may charge Borrower fees for services performed in connection with Borrower's Default to protect Lender's interest in the Property and rights under this Security Instrument, including: (i) reasonable attorneys' fees and costs; (ii) property inspection and valuation fees; and (iii) other related fees.\n(c) Permissibility of Fees. In regard to any other fees, the absence of express authority in this Security Instrument to charge a specific fee to Borrower should not be construed as a prohibition on the charging of such fee. Lender may not charge fees that are expressly prohibited by this Security Instrument or by Applicable Law.\n(d) Savings Clause. If Applicable Law sets maximum loan charges, and that law is finally interpreted so that the interest or other loan charges collected or to be collected in connection with the Loan exceed the permitted limits, then (i) any such loan charge will be reduced by the amount necessary to reduce the charge to the permitted limit, and (ii) any sums already collected from Borrower which exceeded permitted limits will be refunded to Borrower. Lender may make this refund by reducing the principal owed under the Note or by making a direct payment to Borrower. If a refund reduces principal, the reduction will be treated as a partial prepayment without any prepayment charge (whether or not a prepayment charge is provided for under the Note). To the extent permitted by Applicable Law, Borrower's acceptance of any such refund made by direct payment to Borrower will constitute a waiver of any right of action Borrower might have arising out of such overcharge.\n1\n16. Notices; Borrower's Physical Address. All notices given by Borrower or Lender in connection with this Security Instrument must be in writing.\n(a) Notices to Borrower. Unless Applicable Law requires a different method, any written notice to Borrower in connection with this Security Instrument will be deemed to have been given to Borrower when (i) mailed by first class mail, or (ii) actually delivered to Borrower's Notice Address (as defined in Section 16(c) below) if sent by means other than first class mail or Electronic Communication (as defined in Section 16(b) below). Notice to any one Borrower will constitute notice to all Borrowers unless Applicable Law expressly requires otherwise. If any notice to Borrower required by this Security Instrument is also required under Applicable Law, the Applicable Law requirement will satisfy the corresponding requirement under this Security Instrument.\n(b) Electronic Notice to Borrower. Unless another delivery method is required by Applicable Law, Lender may provide notice to Borrower by e-mail or other electronic communication (\"Electronic Communication\") if: (i) agreed to by Lender and Borrower in writing; (ii) Borrower has provided Lender with Borrower's e-mail or other electronic address (\"Electronic Address\"); (iii) Lender provides Borrower with the option to receive notices by first class mail or by other non-Electronic Communication instead of by Electronic Communication; and (iv) Lender otherwise complies with Applicable Law. Any notice to Borrower sent by Electronic Communication in connection with this Security Instrument will be deemed to have been given to Borrower when sent unless Lender becomes aware that such notice is not delivered. If Lender becomes aware that any notice sent by Electronic Communication is not delivered, Lender will resend such communication to Borrower by first class mail or by other non-Electronic Communication. Borrower may withdraw the agreement to receive Electronic Communications from Lender at any time by providing written notice to Lender of Borrower's withdrawal of such-agreement.\n(c) Borrower's Notice Address. The address to which Lender will send Borrower notice (\"Notice Address\") will be the Property Address unless Borrower has designated a different address by written notice to Lender. If Lender and Borrower have agreed that notice may be given by Electronic Communication, then Borrower may designate an Electronic Address as Notice Address. Borrower will promptly notify Lender of Borrower's change of Notice Address, including any changes to Borrower's Electronic Address if designated as Notice Address. If Lender specifies a procedure for reporting Borrower's change of Notice Address, then Borrower will report a change of Notice Address only through that specified procedure.\n(d) Notices to Lender. Any notice to Lender will be given by delivering it or by mailing it by first\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 13 of 18\n1\n8000327681\nclass mail to Lender's address stated in this Security Instrument unless Lender has designated another address (including an Electronic Address) by notice to Borrower. Any notice in connection with this Security Instrument will be deemed to have been given to Lender only when actually received by Lender at Lender's designated address (which may include an Electronic Address). If any notice to Lender required by this Security Instrument is also required under Applicable Law, the Applicable Law requirement will satisfy the corresponding requirement under this Security Instrument.\n(e) Borrower's Physical Address. In addition to the designated Notice Address, Borrower will provide Lender with the address where Borrower physically resides, if different from the Property Address, and notify Lender whenever this address changes.\n1 17. Governing Law; Severability; Rules of Construction. This Security Instrument is governed by federal law and the law of the State of Washington. All rights and obligations contained in this Security Instrument are subject to any requirements and limitations of Applicable Law. If any provision of this Security Instrument or the Note conflicts with Applicable Law (i) such conflict will not affect other provisions of this Security Instrument or the Note that can be given effect without the conflicting provision, and (ii) such conflicting provision, to the extent possible, will be considered modified to comply with Applicable Law. Applicable Law might explicitly or implicitly allow the parties to agree by contract or it might be silent, but such silence should not be construed as a prohibition against agreement by contract. Any action required under this Security Instrument to be made in accordance with Applicable Law is to be made in accordance with the Applicable Law in effect at the time the action is undertaken.\nAs used in this Security Instrument: (a) words in the singular will mean and include the plural and vice versa; (b) the word \"may\" gives sole discretion without any obligation to take any action; (c) any reference to \"Section\" in this document refers to Sections contained in this Security Instrument unless otherwise noted; and (d) the headings and captions are inserted for convenience of reference and do not define, limit, or describe the scope or intent of this Security Instrument or any particular Section, paragraph, or provision.\n18. Borrower's Copy. One Borrower will be given one copy of the Note and of this Security Instrument.\n19. Transfer of the Property or a Beneficial Interest in Borrower. For purposes of this Section 19 only, \"Interest in the Property\" means any legal or beneficial interest in the Property, including, but not limited to, those beneficial interests transferred in a bond for deed, contract for deed, installment sales contract, or escrow agreement, the intent of which is the transfer of title by Borrower to a purchaser at a future date.\nIf all or any part of the Property or any Interest in the Property is sold or transferred (or if Borrower is not a natural person and a beneficial interest in Borrower is sold or transferred) without Lender's prior written consent, Lender may require immediate payment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument. However, Lender will not exercise this option if such exercise is prohibited by Applicable Law.\nIf Lender exercises this option, Lender will give Borrower notice of acceleration. The notice will provide a period of not less than 30 days from the date the notice is given in accordance with Section 16 within which Borrower must pay all sums secured by this Security Instrument. If Borrower fails to pay these sums prior to, or upon, the expiration of this period, Lender may invoke any remedies permitted by this Security Instrument without further notice or demand on Borrower and will be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing such remedies, including, but not limited to: (a) reasonable attorneys' fees and costs; (b) property inspection and valuation fees; and (c) other fees incurred to protect Lender's Interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument.\n20. Borrower's Right to Reinstate the Loan after Acceleration. If Borrower meets certain conditions, Borrower will have the right to reinstate the Loan and have enforcement of this Security Instrument discontinued at any time up to the later of (a) five days before any foreclosure sale of the Property, or (b) such other period as Applicable Law might specify for the termination of Borrower's right to\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 14 of 18\n8000327681\nreinstate. This right to reinstate will not apply in the case of acceleration under Section 19.\nTo reinstate the Loan, Borrower must satisfy all of the following conditions: (aa) pay Lender all sums that then would be due under this Security Instrument and the Note as if no acceleration had occurred; (bb) cure any Default of any other covenants or agreements under this Security Instrument or the Note; (cc) pay all expenses incurred in enforcing this Security Instrument or the Note, including, but not limited to: (i) reasonable attorneys' fees and costs; (ii) property inspection and valuation fees; and (iii) other fees incurred to protect Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument or the Note; and (dd) take such action as Lender may reasonably require to assure that Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument or the Note, and Borrower's obligation to pay the sums secured by this Security Instrument or the Note, will continue unchanged.\nLender may require that Borrower pay such reinstatement sums and expenses in one or more of the following forms, as selected by Lender: (aaa) cash; (bbb) money order; (ccc) certified check, bank check, treasurer's check, or cashier's check, provided any such check is drawn upon an institution whose deposits are insured by a U.S. federal agency, instrumentality, or entity; or (ddd) Electronic Fund Transfer. Upon Borrower's reinstatement of the Loan, this Security Instrument and obligations secured by this Security Instrument will remain fully effective as if no acceleration had occurred.\n21. Sale of Note. The Note or a partial interest in the Note, together with this Security Instrument, may be sold or otherwise transferred one or more times. Upon such a sale or other transfer, all of Lender's rights and obligations under this Security Instrument will convey to Lender's successors and assigns.\n22. Loan Servicer. Lender may take any action permitted under this Security Instrument through the Loan Servicer or another authorized representative, such as a sub-servicer. Borrower understands that the Loan Servicer or other authorized representative of Lender has the right and authority to take any such action.\nThe Loan Servicer may change one or more times during the term of the Note. The Loan Servicer may or may not be the holder of the Note. The Loan Servicer has the right and authority to: (a) collect Periodic Payments and any other amounts due under the Note and this Security Instrument; (b) perform any other mortgage loan servicing obligations; and (c) exercise any rights under the Note, this Security Instrument, and Applicable Law on behalf of Lender. If there is a change of the Loan Servicer, Borrower will be given written notice of the change which will state the name and address of the new Loan Servicer, the address to which payments should be made, and any other information RESPA requires in connection with a notice of transfer of servicing.\n23. Notice of Grievance. Until Borrower or Lender has notified the other party (in accordance with Section 16) of an alleged breach and afforded the other party a reasonable period after the giving of such notice to take corrective action, neither Borrower nor Lender may commence, join, or be joined to any judicial action (either as an individual litigant or a member of a class) that (a) arises from the other party's actions pursuant to this Security Instrument or the Note, or (b) alleges that the other party has breached any provision of this Security, Instrument or the Note. If Applicable Law provides a time period that must elapse before certain action can be taken, that time period will be deemed to be reasonable for purposes of this Section 23. The notice of Default given to Borrower pursuant to Section 26(a) and the notice of acceleration given to Borrower pursuant to Section 19 will be deemed to satisfy the notice and opportunity to take corrective action provisions of this Section 23.\n24. Hazardous Substances.\n(a) Definitions. As used in this Section 24: (i) \"Environmental Law\" means any Applicable Laws where the Property is located that relate to health, safety, or environmental protection; (ii) \"Hazardous Substances\" include (A) those substances defined as toxic or hazardous substances, pollutants, or wastes by Environmental Law, and (B) the following substances: gasoline, kerosene, other flammable or toxic petroleum products, toxic pesticides and herbicides, volatile solvents, materials containing asbestos or formaldehyde, corrosive materials or agents, and radioactive materials; (iii) \"Environmental Cleanup\"\nWASHINGTON-Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 15 of 18\n8000327681\nincludes any response action, remedial action, or removal action, as defined in Environmental Law; and (iv) an \"Environmental Condition\" means a condition that can cause, contribute to, or otherwise trigger an Environmental Cleanup.\n(b) Restrictions on Use of Hazardous Substances. Borrower will not cause or permit the presence, use, disposal, storage, or release of any Hazardous Substances, or threaten to release any Hazardous Substances, on or in the Property. Borrower will not do, nor allow anyone else to do, anything affecting the Property that: (i) violates Environmental Law; (ii) creates an Environmental Condition; or (iii) due to the presence, use, or release of a Hazardous Substance, creates a condition that adversely affects or could adversely affect the value of the Property. The preceding two sentences will not apply to the presence, use, or storage on the Property of small quantities of Hazardous Substances that are generally recognized to be appropriate to normal residential uses and to maintenance of the Property (including, but not limited to, hazardous substances in consumer products).\n(c) Notices; Remedial Actions. Borrower will promptly give Lender written notice of: (i) any investigation, claim, demand, lawsuit, or other action by any governmental or regulatory agency or private party involving the Property and any Hazardous Substance or Environmental Law of which Borrower has actual knowledge; (ii) any Environmental Condition, including but not limited to, any spilling, leaking, discharge, release, or threat of release of any Hazardous Substance; and (iii) any condition caused by the presence, use, or release of a Hazardous Substance that adversely affects the value of the Property. If Borrower learns, or is notified by any governmental or regulatory authority or any private party, that any removal or other remediation of any Hazardous Substance affecting the Property is necessary, Borrower will promptly take all necessary remedial actions in accordance with Environmental Law. Nothing in this Security Instrument will create any obligation on Lender for an Environmental Cleanup.\n25. Electronic Note Signed with Borrower's Electronic Signature. If the Note evidencing the debt for this Loan is electronic, Borrower acknowledges and represents to Lender that Borrower: (a) expressly consented and intended to sign the electronic Note using an Electronic Signature adopted by Borrower (\"Borrower's Electronic Signature\") instead of signing a paper Note with Borrower's written pen and ink signature; (b) did not withdraw Borrower's express consent to sign the electronic Note using Borrower's Electronic Signature; (c) understood that by signing the electronic Note using Borrower's Electronic Signature, Borrower promised to pay the debt evidenced by the electronic Note in accordance with its terms; and (d) signed the electronic Note with Borrower's Electronic Signature with the intent and understanding that by doing so, Borrower promised to pay the debt evidenced by the electronic Note in accordance with its terms.\nNON-UNIFORM COVENANTS. Borrower and Lender further covenant and agree as follows:\n26. Acceleration; Remedies.\n(a) Notification of Default. Lender will give a notification of Default to Borrower prior to acceleration following Borrower's Default, except that such notification of Default will not be sent when Lender exercises its right under Section 19 unless Applicable Law provides otherwise. The notification will specify, in addition to any other information required by Applicable Law: (i) the Default; (ii) the action required to cure the Default; (iii) a date, not less than 30 days (or as otherwise specified by Applicable Law) from the date the notification is given to Borrower, by which the Default must be cured; (iv) that failure to cure the Default on or before the date specified in the notification may result in acceleration of the sums secured by this Security Instrument and sale of the Property at public auction; (v) Borrower's right to reinstate after acceleration or commencement of the foreclosure in accordance with Applicable law; and (vi) any other matters required to be included in the notification by Applicable Law.\n(b) Acceleration; Power of Sale; Expenses. If the Default is not cured on or before the date specified in the notification, Lender, and in accordance with Applicable Law, may require immediate\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT CX) 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 16 of 18\n8000327681\npayment in full of all sums secured by this Security Instrument without further demand and may invoke the power of sale and/or any other remedies permitted by Applicable Law. Lender will be entitled to collect all expenses incurred in pursuing the remedies provided in this Section 26, including, but not limited to: (i) reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, and other fees and costs associated with the enforcement of this Security Instrument, including but not limited to, foreclosure trustee's and sheriff's fees and costs, and title costs; (ii) property inspection and valuation fees; and (iii) any other fees incurred to protect Lender's interest in the Property and/or rights under this Security Instrument unless prohibited by Applicable Law.\n(c) Foreclosure Notices; Sale of Property. If Lender invokes the power of sale, Lender will send notice to Trustee of the occurrence of an event of Default and of Lender's election to cause the Property to be sold. Trustee and/or Lender will take such action regarding any required notices and will give such notices to Borrower and to other recipients as Applicable Law may require. At a time permitted, in accordance with Applicable Law, and after publication of the notice of sale, Trustee, without further demand on Borrower, will sell the Property at public auction to the highest bidder at the time and place and under the terms designated in the notice of sale in one or more parcels and in any order Trustee determines. Trustee may postpone sale of the Property for a period or periods permitted by Applicable Law by public announcement at the time and place fixed in the notice of sale. Lender or its designee may purchase the Property at any sale.\n(d) Trustee's Deed; Proceeds of Sale. Trustee will deliver to the purchaser a Trustee's deed conveying the Property without any covenant or warranty, expressed or implied. The recitals in the Trustee's deed will be prima facie evidence of the truth of the statements made in that deed. Trustee will apply the proceeds of the sale in the following order: (i) to all expenses of the sale, including, but not limited to, reasonable Trustee's and attorneys' fees and costs; (ii) to all sums secured by this Security Instrument; and (iii) the surplus, if any, less the clerk's filing fee, shall be deposited, together with all documents required under Applicable Law, with the clerk of the superior court of the county in which the sale took place.\n27. Reconveyance. Upon payment of all sums secured by this Security Instrument, Lender will request Trustee to reconvey the Property and will surrender this Security Instrument and all Notes evidencing the debt secured by this Security Instrument to Trustee. Upon such request, Trustee will reconvey the Property without warranty to the person or persons legally entitled to it. Such person or persons will pay any recordation costs and the Trustee's fee for preparing the reconveyance.\n28. Substitute Trustee. In accordance with Applicable Law, Lender may, from time to time; by itself or through the Loan Servicer, or any other authorized representative, appoint a successor trustee to any Trustee appointed under this Security Instrument who has ceased to act. Without conveyance of the Property, the successor trustee will succeed to all the rights, title, power, and duties conferred upon Trustee in this Security Instrument and by Applicable Law.\n29. Use of Property. The Property is not used principally for agricultural purposes.\n30. Attorneys' Fees. Lender will be entitled to recover in any action or proceeding to construe or enforce any term of this Security Instrument (a) its reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, and (b) any other fees and costs associated with the enforcement of this Security Instrument, including but not limited to, foreclosure trustee and sheriff's fees and costs and title costs. The term \"attorneys' fees,\" whenever used in this Security Instrument, includes without limitation attorneys' fees incurred by Lender in any bankruptcy proceeding or on appeal.\nORAL AGREEMENTS OR ORAL COMMITMENTS TO LOAN MONEY, EXTEND CREDIT, OR TO FORBEAR FROM ENFORCING REPAYMENT OF A DEBT ARE NOT ENFORCEABLE UNDER WASHINGTON LAW.\nWASHINGTON -- Single Family -- Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac UNIFORM INSTRUMENT 25327.11\nForm 3048 07/2021 (rev. 09/22)\nPage 17 of 18\n8000327681\nBY SIGNING BELOW, Borrower accepts and agrees to the terms and covenants contained in this Security Instrument and in any Rider signed by Borrower and recorded with it.\n- BORROWER - CORNELIU MICHAELS Students\nSIMONA MICHAELS\n[Space Below This Line for Acknowledgment]\nState of WASHINGTON County of SNOHOMISH\nThis record was acknowledged before me on October 08.2024 by CORNELIU MICHAELS AND SIMONA MICHAELS.\nJana K Quinn MY COMM.
